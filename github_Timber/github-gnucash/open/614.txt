title:Several currencies export problems

DB with different currencies
When exporting app creates several files, one for each currency (in which of them multi currency transactions?). For what is it needed?
When i import file with not main currency, gnucash create duplicate counts branchs, but in the end of branc count have my main currency, not currency of the file.
QIF does not support currency information. So GnuCash creates a file for each of the currencies in use so that during import, you could specify what currency it is in the desktop importer.
This works well when you use different currencies in different (non-linked) accounts. But when working with multi-currency transactions, not so much.
If I recall correctly , during export multi-currency transactions will be exported with the amount converted to the currency of the exported file. So I think if you import only one of the files, you get all your transactions and avoid duplicates. Please correct me if I'm wrong @rivaldi8

@codinguser the conversion of multi-currency transactions is not merged yet (see #571).
