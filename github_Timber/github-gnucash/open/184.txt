title:On the widget, negatives values are green in 1.4.0

On the widget, negative values are now green, they used to be red as I would have expected.
This is dependent on the normal balance of the account.
Previous versions of the app simply added credits and subtracted debits,
but GnuCash account types handle things differently. For some accounts,
like Expense accounts, debits increase the balance while debits decrease
it. Look at it this way, if you buy something, your expenses go up, and
your assets (cash) goes down.

For me, this on credit card account.  The balance displays as negative, but its displayed in green.  I believe it should be display in red.  It used to be display in red.
