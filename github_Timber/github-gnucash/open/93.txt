title:Language selector (feature)

A suggest to implement a language selector in Gnucash.
Many time, a device has a set system language, but we prefer to use another one only in some applications.
So could be great to have a way to choose your prefered language.
I totally agree!
Sometimes the translated strings are not very good for the default system language, so we should be able to select another one.
