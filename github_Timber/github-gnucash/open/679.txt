I can find all transaction records from the raw data of the exported file.
I tried to import the file into desktop version.

Do you mean all the data imported into this app on, for example, April 4th, will be considered happened on that date. So when I tried to export the data from April 3rd till now, these records are included as well?

@Explorare and @codinguser
I think I had the same problem:
The problem is when opening the gnucash file from desktop in android mobile and exporting on the same day.
Then, because everything was entered on this day gnucash android will export every entry on this day. Maybe I'm wrong.
This is a bug no? Because the date of the individual entry should be read out.
