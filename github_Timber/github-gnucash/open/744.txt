title:Better layout for resizing the widget

There is currently one widget available with all the functionality I'm looking for: account name, balance, and the ability to create new transaction straight from the widget.
However, it is taking too much space. What I like to do is resize the widget to 1x1 size only and still have all the options layed out correctly.
I will look into adjusting this.
All the information and functionality retained in the new layout.
The layout hides most of the information and the plus button for creating transactions.
The method is already user here. The number of columns is calculated and then a different layout is loaded. It is enough if only the 1x1 layout is created. Perhaps 2x1, also.
