title:widget refresh slower for more transactions

#202 fixed the bug that saving was slow because it waited for the widgets to refresh.
The widget refresh is still slow if there are many transactions.
How slow? Is it a momentary pause, a few seconds, minutes or more?

At the moment it's about 2 seconds. But it seems to increase with the
number of transactions in the book.
It ist the same for all accounts, no matter if there are just a few
transactions in an account or a lot.
Are all transactions of the book processed to calculate the sum of one
account for the widget?

oh, it seems I misread your original post.
You don't mean that transaction saving is slow, rather that it takes some time for the widget to update right?
