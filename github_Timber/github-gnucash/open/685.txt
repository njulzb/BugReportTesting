title:GnuCash crashes when auto backup triggers

Nothing specific, just use your device and when the scheduled auto backup triggers a pop-up shows up that tells you that GnuCash has stopped.
When auto backup triggers GnuCash should not crash.
GnuCash crashes regularly every time auto backup triggers. See attachment: logcat.txt
ok, that's not good :(
Will look into it, thanks for the log file.

Are you storing the backups in Google Drive? You can check by going to Settings > Backup & export. Under Select backup file you should have something like com.google.android.apps.docs.storage.
