title:Export since date exports previous dates as well

PS: No I do not have scheduled export turned on. I did have it when I was beta testing months ago.
PS 2: I do not import into Gnucash Android as per your question on this issue.
Export only transactions dated after the "since date"
Export includes previous dates (seems random).
For example I tried exporting since May 10 and I got 5 random records from April. I did this  multiple times.
