title:Bug: scheduled transactions with multiple splits end up going to imbalance

Ive noticed that my scheduled transactions imported from desktop with multiple splits will chuck it in imbalance instead of where the split shows.
One example is salary, have $100,000,000 (i wish!) in income:salary, and then all that goes to assets:bank. I also have some in same split going budget:thing1, budget:thing2 and the sum of all the budgets (inversed) to budget so it all cancels out.
What i actually see is -$100,000,000 in imbalance and $100,000,000 in budget. And $0 in everything else.
The budget technique is from http://allmybrain.com/2008/12/15/better-budgeting-with-gnucash/
If it helps i can probably set up an example book to do this, this report was based off my ongoing book.
Yes please, an example book would be awesome and would help us fix the
problem.
Thank you.

I have similar problem, and noticed that the transaction currency was different than the split quantity and split value currencies.

I think I can reproduce it with my expenses file. In my case they are just simple transactions transferring from one account.
@hughdavenport in your case do you have multiple currencies in the affected transactions like @pnemonic78 or just one?

Hey,
Sorry I completely forgot about this one! From memory it was just the one currency. I haven't really been using this app for a while.
