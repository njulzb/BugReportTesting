title:Account Total does not match desktop after import

From Google+ user group:
I met a strange bug on the mismatch of the transaction history and the total.
So I'm wondering if there is a bug with time zone? My computer uses GMT +8, so is my Android device.
I've checked the details of the transactions and found that the time was logged with 18:59:00 but were actually created on 11:30 (GMT +8)
GnuCash desktop version: 2.6.15
GnuCash Android version: 2.1.4
Device: BlackBerry PRIV with Android 6.0.1
All the numbers matched again after the time passed 18:59:00.
