I'm not able to reproduce this on my device (Nexus 5, Android 6).
@rivaldi8 can you reproduce this?

@nikopp yes, it helps. I'll be on the lookout for it.
Thanks

@codinguser I'd swear I reproduced it yesterday, but I'm unable to do so now. As I keep changing branches, maybe it was with another one or under another condition.
@nikopp Are you able to reproduce it always?

@rivaldi8 No. A few weeks ago it happened all the time but now it often works several times before it crashes.

I now have a new phone and the problem is still there on a Samsung galaxy a3 with Oreo.
I sent several crash reports in the past week.
