title:Option to invert the transaction color for DEBIT/CREDIT accounts

I have a liability (credit card) account. I think that charges should be red, and payments should be green. I look at the color, only later do I read the writing on the button (charge or payment). For a non-bookkeeper person red is "negative" and charging things is "bad" (red). Paying down the balance of the credit card is "positive" (green).
I know this is part of the debit / credit, which I still struggle to keep straight. And on a credit card, charging an item is "adding" to the balance, meaning increasing the amount you owe.
Credit Card is a type of "liability". So in a liability account, spending is increasing the liability, hence its adding to it, so it is green. Adding money to liability reduces it, so its red.

@dhwaneetbhatt yes, the point is that increasing a liability should be red because it is more natural (red="bad", green="good").

I agree with this, the color scheme should be reversed for liabilities, it makes more sense.

I would like an option to ignore the type of account such that debit is always green and credit is always red.
The colours now are so confusing which makes tracking money flow difficult. In accounting terms money flows from credit to debit, regardless of asset, liability / equity, revenue / expense.
