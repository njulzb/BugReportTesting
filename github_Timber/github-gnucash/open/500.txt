title:Setup an FDroid App Repo

To get easy/automatic upgrades for those who don't want to sign up for a Google account, it would be useful to setup an independent f-droid repository (given the official one won't ship gnucash-android as per #435).
See https://f-droid.org/wiki/page/Setup_an_FDroid_App_Repo for instructions.
