title:[USER REPORT] Reports not displayed when there is no internet

When the wifi is on, but too distant of a wifi source, and 3G is on, but without credits in the cell company, the graphics and reports show "no data avaliable".
Reports always shown
"No data available" is displayed.
To solve the problem I need to turn off the 3G function in the smartphone's configuration.
It works for me offline, but just have to wait because the report generation sometimes takes a long time.
