title:Feature Request: Business functions

My main use of the app is for work. I deal with vendors and customers all day, and the app already saves me a butt ton of bookkeeping work in the office at the end of the day. But there still is work, because anyplace I buy parts and supplies where I have an account can't be entered into the app. Nor can I attach those receipts to customers or job orders.
So I, for one, would really appreciate the addition of those functions. :)
Hi,
To be honest, business features would be great to have,  but are not
currently a priority. The focus is on making the consumer features refined
and working well. And there is still stuff like budgets under development.
When that is done, then maybe focus will shift to business. But this is
very long term planning. Unless of course someone starts sending in code
for business features.
Thanks for the feedback.
Cheers,
