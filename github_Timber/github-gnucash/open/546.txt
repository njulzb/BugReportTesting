title:Use implicit decimals in account fields for currencies with 2 decimal places

This is a UserVoice request.
Amounts entered would always start input from the decimal fields, allowing quick input of amounts.
This feature existed before and was removed on popular request by those whose currencies did not support decimals.
One option would be to make it default on for currencies with decimals and off for those without. In addition, a setting could force it on or off.
