title:Problem with decimals when editing transactions

Edit any simple transaction (just two acounts) without decimals. You won't be able to insert a decimal comma (or a decimal point) in the amount.
You should be able to add decimals when editing the transaction amount.
As a workaround, you have to select the "split transaction" button to be able to add them.
