Set default export format to OFX
Exporting transactions will result in a file of the chosen format
Export Transactions window shows OFX radio button selected for export format, however, the exported file is of QIF format.  Problem does not occur if the user selects first the QIF radio button and then switches back to the OFX button; in that case, an OFX file is produced as expected.
