title:Export to external service is broken in 2.0.1

This happens on both of my devices i use it on. I just noticed it with GnuCash Version 2.0.1. Version 2.0.0 still did it for me.
Both devices run Android 4.2.2 with a Kernel Version of 3.4.5. One is a ASUS MeMo Pad 7 HD, the other a Samsung S3 Mini.
GnuCash Android version is 2.0.1 on both.
What do i do:
Expected outcome:
The sharing services show up and i choose one. In my case i would use the official owncloud app to put the qif file on my private server.
What does happen:
Nothing. It claims to export. Then the "Export to external Service" message pops up, but the service selection never shows.
What else did i check:
I tried to send files via other apps. The ES Explorer opened the menu without a problem and let me put files on my owncloud as usual.
As for now, i workaround the issue by exporting to SD card and sending with another application, but to put it frankly: That's a bit tedious.
If you need anything else from me, just let me know.
We are working on this.
Thanks for the feedback
