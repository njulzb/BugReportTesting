title:"Save" and "Cancel" transaction buttons are disappeared from the menu bar

Buttons for saving and cancelling transaction are disappeared from the menu bar in transaction editor since version 1.6.0. Now I need to open menu and click buttons there, but this is less comfortable. Please, re-add buttons to the menu bar.

Does this happen in v1.6.2 as well?
