title:OFX file has no encoding information

codinguser
And it seems has no OFX header section at all, I mean:
(http://www.ofx.net/OFXExamplesPage/OFXExamples.aspx)
OFXHEADER:100
DATA:OFXSGML
VERSION:102
SECURITY:NONE
ENCODING:USASCII
CHARSET:1252
COMPRESSION:NONE
OLDFILEUID:NONE
NEWFILEUID:NONE
Contents of the exported file look like only clean xml.
So, when I try to import file in Gnucash 2.4.2 on my Linux I see scrabbled characters instead of Russian (UTF-8).
If I add at the beginning of the file this: "ENCODING:UTF-8" Gnucash shows all characters fine.
Hi!
Today I've made apk from latest develop and tried export OFX and import.
Suppose fix didn't resolve problem... GnuCash cannot understand encoding (version 2.4.11 too).
I dug more about OFX file format and found out this:
Old version of OFX header was a set of parameters as I wrote in previous post including "ENCODING:UTF-8",
new version has only several required params and another syntax (that one you use):
And parameter ENCODING="UTF-8" hasn't to be there and should be ignored by software.
So, latest changes should be rolled back :(. Sorry.
Idea is xml header () already has encoding information.
Only way I can make Gnucash show correct encoding is to add old OFX version header part "ENCODING:UTF-8" in the beginning of OFX.
It seems problem is in Gnucash, I'll try inform developers.
But only as walk-around is it possible add old styte header in OFX?
