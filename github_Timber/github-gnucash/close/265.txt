title:Error on import account tree on Android L

I tried to import account tree, which i already did on Android 4.4.4 and it is showing this error:

Syntax error at line 1, column 0 when tried to import account tree from gnucash desktop file
And you are positive it is exactly the same file you tried for both cases?

Yes, and i did two more tests:
Export file generated by other gnucash desktop instalation (windows): same error
Other android phone tunning 4.4.4 tried to import same file: same error.

It had to be the export account, not the export account tree.
