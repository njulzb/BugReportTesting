title:owncloud integration

It would be useful to have synchronization support to owncloud, in addition to the dropbox/gdrive ones.
See http://www.owncloud.org
Support for ownCloud is already present in the develop branch and will be
released in the future

No date on the next minor release (which will support ownCloud).
But patch releases will be coming out often. The next one is in a few days.
