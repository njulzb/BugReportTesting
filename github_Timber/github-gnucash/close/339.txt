title:'Permission denied' during export

Whenever I try to export, no matter which format, I get a 'permission denied' toast.
Here is the relevant part of the log:
Funnily enough, the parent directory of the file to be created does exist and seems to be writeable:
My phone is a Moto G 2014 running Lolipop. I also have a MicroSD card, which is mounted at /storage/sdcard1. The app was installed via F-Droid, the version is 1.5.5.
