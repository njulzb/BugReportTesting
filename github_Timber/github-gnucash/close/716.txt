title:Mutual fund, stock, other "XXX currency" assets are not calculated.

It should be expected that asset value is calculated and shown at each parent level. The quantity of shares at the fund or stock account level should also be shown.
$0 and 0# of shares is shown at all account levels.
Thanks for the bug report @mutedbytes
Sorry, but the app does not support stock or mutual fund type accounts.
The account types are only listed there to support importing data from GnuCash desktop without messing it up. But the app doesn't have any support for those account types.
