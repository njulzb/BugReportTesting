title:Internationalization bug: incorrect comma-handling

When setting the phone-language to e.g. German, the overviews (both "Accounts" overview and the list of transactions) incorrectly handle the "," in the amount and display 100 times the amount of the transactons.
Example:
used version: Gnucash 1.0 on Cyanogenmod 9
Are you sure you are using the beta 2? Because this issue has been fixed.
See issues #3 and #11.
