title:Do not use .Dialog Themes from ActionBarSherlock

codinguser
According to JakeWharton/ActionBarSherlock#892, all .Dialog themes are removed in the latest version of ABS. Is it possible to replace the use of Theme.Sherlock.Light.Dialog?
From AndroidManifest.xml, line 65:
android:theme="@style/Theme.Sherlock.Light.Dialog"
Not sure how to replace it, yet.
Thanks for the heads up! I don't know what's recommended to use instead. I'll try to find out.

So:
But then R.color.abs__holo_blue_light does not exist, used in org.gnucash.android.ui.accounts.AccountsListFragment and org.gnucash.android.ui.transactions.TransactionsListFragment. I cannot see if this was a problem previously, or because of upgrading to ABS 4.3.1. Working on it, maybe file another issue.

It appears abs__holo_blue_light was removed as part of the .Dialogs removal. For now, I just added <color name="abs__holo_blue_light">#ff33b5e5</color> to /GnucashMobile/res/values/colors.xml. Not sure whether you want to replace the color with something else.

No, I don't want to replace it. Adding the color to resources would be fine. Thanks for the patch.
