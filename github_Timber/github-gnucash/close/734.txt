title:General export seems to corrupt the backup

The error is both the same even when I try the zip or the (unzipped qif)
import the books
as described before
Recently updated to Android 7.1.x (LineageOS) as well.
Just tried to export for the first time since that switch. Same problem as OP.
But I think I might have a clue on why it's not working:
After the export via Save As... one get's back to Gnucash-android. Below the Save As... selection the path to which was exported to is shown.
Notice the beginning of the path: content://com.android.externalstorage.......
I recently had problems with KeepassDroid saving changes to its database.
Back then I searched around until I found this: bpellin/keepassdroid#75
As taylormarshall states in his third post, it seems to come down to supporting content:// URI.
