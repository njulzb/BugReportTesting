title:allow more than one book?

codinguser
Suppose I use GnuCash to track my own accounts, and also those of an organization I belong to. On the desktop, I'd simply keep them in two different books (foo.gnucash files).
It would be nice if the Android app could separately import the different trees of accounts, and have a 'select other book' option somewhere to permit switching between them, and exporting one or the other at a time.
I'm unsure whether the passcode feature request (#39) would best allow different passcodes for different books, or just one for the app overall. Something to think about....
I'd like to see this feature implemented. (Couldn't finde a vote-button...)

Having the option of multiple ledgers would also be usefull to workaround the issue with missing currency code in QIF exports for syncing with the desktop app.
The user might setup a separate ledger for each currency in use and then import to a single .gnucash file on desktop with appropriate currency denomination.

The Android app already exports one QIF file per currency in your book. So you
can just import those separately on the desktop. You get to choose the
currency during import.

You cannot import .gnucash files on the desktop.
