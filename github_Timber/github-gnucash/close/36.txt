title:Default transaction type is always DEBIT in non-English locale

codinguser
Option "default transaction type" does not have effect in non-English locale, so in transaction creation window transaction type is always set to "DEBIT".
I think that you compare localized and non-localized values. But it's wrong because "CREDIT" != "КРЕДИТ".
Steps to reproduce:
1.1. set phone localization to Russian (Русский)
1.2. open GnuCash and set default transaction type to "КРЕДИТ"
1.3. create new transaction and check transaction type in the corresponding field
2.1. set phone localization to English (United States)
2.2. open GnuCash and set default transaction type to "CREDIT"
2.3. create new transaction and check transaction type in the corresponding field
Results:
1.3. FAIL: transaction type is "ДЕБЕТ"
2.3 OK: transaction type is "CREDIT"
