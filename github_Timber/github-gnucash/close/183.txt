title:Missing docs on multi currency setup: is this implemented at all?

Say, I have a EUR asset account and a USD liability. There seems no way to raise the liability in USD with corresponding EUR asset increase. Only similar currency asset accounts are offered for selection.
Is this by design? No cross currency transactions allowed?
Yes, that is correct, this is by design.
Multiple currencies are not supported for transfers and splits (yet)

How about the balances on non-default currency accounts? Looks like these balances are simply ignored, there is no options for setting the exchange rates?

There is no support for exchange rates or anything similar, sorry.
Yes, I think when computing the account balance, any transactions with a
different currency are skipped (as there is no support for conversion).
