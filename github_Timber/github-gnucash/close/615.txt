title:Timestamp 0 when never exported.

A message like Never exported.
Last exported: 1970-01-Ã 1 01-00-00.0
Fixed in hotfix/patches.
By the way, I could only reproduce it by going through the first run wizard and choosing to create the account myself. Creating a new book in any other way would always set the current date as last exported.
