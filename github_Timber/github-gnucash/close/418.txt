title:Danish translation is in Norwegian

I don't think there's a single string in Danish in values-da-rDK/strings.xml; from what I can tell the entire file is in Norwegian. (No idea whether it's Bokmål or Nynorsk though.) Is there a reason for this? It was added in 0d3e0c7 which doesn't give a whole lot of context in the commit message, other than mentioning CrowdIn (which isn't mentioned in the referenced help-to-translate blog post - is that what we're supposed to be using if we want to help with translations?).
I think I uploaded translations in error.
I will revert them to English

But is CrowdIn what I'm supposed to use if I do want to help contribute Danish translations?
