Ok, I've verified it's fixed by that commit. It'll appear fixed in version 2.1.3. You may need to remove the widget and add it again for it to work.

@rivaldi8 yes, that commit adds support for selecting the book when adding a widget

@rivaldi8 The problem is still present in 2.1.3. I did remove the widgets and added them again.
But it happens only sometimes, not as often as with 2.1.2.
And the widgets start working again without recreating.
I couldn't find out why they stop or why restart working. There seems to be no obvious trigger.
I also had the case that only some widgets for one book show the message while others still work fine.
Do you want to reopen this bug or should I file a new one?

This makes me think we are dealing with a different, although similar, bug. If you don't mind, I'll rather have it filed as new bug. Thanks!
