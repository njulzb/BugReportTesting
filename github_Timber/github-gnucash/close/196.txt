title:Need ability to delete transactions

GnuCash for Android does not appear to be able to delete a single transaction. Previously, the only way to delete a transaction was to edit it and make the amount 0. Since transaction editing is broken in 1.4.2 (see previous incident), that is not an option.
Even after editing of transactions is fixed, it would be much better if a transaction could be deleted from the UI instead of being zeroed out.
There is a checkbox before every transaction (well, it is very hard to see). Just check it and the delete button (a recycle bin) will appear on the upper right corner.
UI should be improve to make it more clear.

I see. Yes, the UI should be more clear. Having the ability to delete from the edit window would also be nice. Will close this. May enter a new enhancement request for UI improvement.
