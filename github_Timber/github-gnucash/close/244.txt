title:Cannot find button to delete transaction

I am unable to find any button or what so ever to delete a single transaction. I think this should be possible and there should be a button for this. Or am I just blind and cant find it?

Thank you I looked for a feature to select transactions and tried to double click the transaction to select it or to press it for a second. This is what I am used from other apps. Maybe this should be another way to select a transaction.
