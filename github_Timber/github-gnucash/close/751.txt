title:Feature Request: Starred by Default

Setting to open GnuCash app with the Starred tab being showed (actived instead of the All tab).
Thanks for the request. I'm not sure if there is a enough demand for this feature to justify the resources for it. Currently Gnucash Android shows the last tab you opened.

Will close this now. The last opened tab is used when the app loads.
