title:Translation to Turkish language

Can i help to trasnlate this app for turkish peaple?
Yes you absolutely can.
Visit https://github.com/codinguser/gnucash-android/blob/develop/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml
and download the file, translate it and email it to me and I will take care of the rest.
Or you can do it through GitHub and send me a pull request to my develop branch.
Also see this post for guidelines on the translation: http://www.codinguser.com/2012/09/gnucash-for-android-beta-2-lost-in-translation/
Thanks
