title:XXX Unknown Currency when importing accounts from GNUCash desktop

Currency for all imported accounts should be the same as te currency in the original (i.e. desktop) accounts configuration; it should be consistent with the default currency setting in the gnucash-android app.
All accounts have XXX Unknown currency.
Manually adjusting currency setting for all accounts is a pain, there is no way to propagate the change to all subaccounts.
