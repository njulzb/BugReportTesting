title:Exported QIF file: we cannot import it in GnuCash desktop

Problem
I'm trying to import the following QIF files generated in GnuCash Android inside GnuCash desktop but the desktop application exits without messages or warnings and the import is NOT successful.
can-not-import-desktop.zip
Additional information
I think there is an issue with importing qif's into desktop version 2.6.10 regardless of origin so this may be your problem. Version 2.6.9 and the soon to be released 2.6.11 are good for qif imports apparently.
Cheers Dave H.

I've installed GCA 205 on my Nexus 5 running Android 601;
I've tested the files in GnuCash Desktop 2610 for Windows and for Mac with the same behavior
