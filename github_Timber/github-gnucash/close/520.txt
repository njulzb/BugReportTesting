title:Favorites / Recent Tab show all Accounts

Hi,
when opening GNUCash out of ram when it was opened a while before, the Account Tabs "Recent" and "Favourites" just show all accounts.
A workaround is completely closing the application (removing it out of the RAM).
Using LG G2 (D802)
Android 6.0.1 (CyanogenMod 13.0)
