title:Accounts totals not updated after exporting and deleting all transactions

Version:
The current develop branch 8c95f3b
To produce:
(pre-condition: With some transactions in the accounts tree, the totals shown on the right hand of each account are not zero at the top level accounts view.)
At the top level accounts view, choose "export transaction", and check "export all transaction", "delete all transactions after export".
When the export and delete of transactions are successfully done, the totals for each account remains unchanged.
What is expected:
When the export and delete of transactions are successfully done, the view is refreshed and every total goes to zero.
P.S.
I checked the exported file, the transactions are successfully exported. And when goes into sub-account view or exits and enters the program again, the totals become zero.
