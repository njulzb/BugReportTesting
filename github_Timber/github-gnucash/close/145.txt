title:editing android gnucash account negative all transaction value

I'm using double entry in android gnucash 1.3.1 with 2 account for example
Cash in Wallets (type=CASH)
Expense (type=EXPENSE)
adds transaction
Cash in Wallets -> Expense, 10 "Yuan Renminbi". in Cash in Wallets it's Credit,
in Expense it's debit
then open Cash in Wallets account, use "edit" feature to edit the account
information, change something or nothing just save
actual result: all transaction (1 in this case) becomes negative of current
value
Cash in Wallets <- Expense, 10 "Yuan Renminbi". in Cash in Wallets it's Debit,
in Expense it's Credit
luckily i can edit it again so everything in this account is negative again
back to original value.
I am having trouble replicating this.
When I open the transaction and save in the Expense account, it remains a
debit and also remains a credit in the transfer Cash in Wallets account.
Cash accounts are a type of Asset account which just like Expense accounts
has a debit normal balance (i.e. debits increase balance, and credits
decrease it)

Indeed I've just found exact correct required condition to reproduce
-> the transaction has to be added (or last modified) at A account, and then edit the B account information
any type of account should do, not just cash

just to be careful, i'm writing step by step
remove all accounts
add account A: cash
add account B: expenses
add transaction in B, debit from account A, amount 10.00
edit account A, click save
result: -10 becomes 10 or 10 becomes -10

I can reproduce now. Thanks a lot. That is sooo weird.
I didn't realize that you meant editing the account, not the transaction.
I'll fix this!
