title:App loses all data when an export is cancelled

Do the following in the app:
Now, all data has been deleted even though no took place. :-( Obviously, the data should be deleted only after an export has succeeded.
Hi Peti,
what version of the app are you using? This issue was raised and fixed in #25
If you are on the latest version, you should always have a delete confirmation dialog before anything is deleted.

I have the latest version from the Google play store. I think it's version 1.2.2.

I've tried on Android 4.3, 4.0.3 and 2.3.3, each time I always get a dialog asking to confirm delete when I return to the app. No delete should happen without you explicitly clicking yes in that dialog.
I cannot reproduce this bug.

Sorry. :( But do you still experience this even in version 1.2.3?

To be perfectly honest, I've switched to Expense Register a while ago, which works fine for my purposes.
