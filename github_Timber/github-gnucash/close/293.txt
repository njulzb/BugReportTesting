title:Allow the application to be installed on the external storage

Right now it's not possible to move the application to the external storage (SD card). This is a problem for old phones with small internal memory.
It should be possible to move it to the external storage.
We will consider this. However at the moment, there will be several changes that need to be made to allow the app to go to external storage.
The app (at least in develop branch) uses features (like service, widgets) which when present, it is recommended that it should not be installed on external storage. See here: http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/install-location.html

Ok, I wasn't aware of these new features problematic with external storage.
I've checked for a solution for the service case, but it seems there isn't an easy way to solve it. There is a broadcast Intent that should be received when the external storage is remounted, but it doesn't work:

I'm not sure it's worth complicating the code to allow this. At least in my case I can live building my own APK with the change.
