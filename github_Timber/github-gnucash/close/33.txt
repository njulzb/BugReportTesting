title:amount input problem with Swype

codinguser
When trying to enter an amount and type '1', it repeats printing '1' around 20 times and afterwards it repeats printing '0' infinitely so I get a very big amount ;-)
This is on Motorola Defy+ MB526 Android 2.3.4  with Swype 3.23.89
Same here on a Samsung I9000 with Android 4.0.4 with Swype 3.26.92D.39062.t0.10977.ENSP.
It's a beta version of swype, but still it should work.
When I switch to the built-in Android keyboard the amount can be input without issues.

fizze: at least it is very helpful for me to know it works without swype. I will have to test that, thanks.

This sounds like more an issue with Swype. I don't have any device with Swype preinstalled. But I'll see if I can get into the beta and test it.

It works as intended when Swype is disabled.
BTW, is it a design decision that the user has to type decimal places? I would like to be able to only enter integers which is faster if you don't have to type '00' at the end.
I propose to only display input for decimals after the user typed the decimal separator.

Yes, the decimal places thing is indeed a design decision.

I understand that. Maybe you can think it could be useful to make it configurable via a switch in the settings?

I would like to support the request for adding a switch for automatic pre-fill of double zero instead of decimal places. There are many currencies with smallest coin equal to 1 - no cents. This would speed up new entries almost twice.

Swype amount input still an issue (on Motorola X2)

I've just not been able to reliably replicate this problem. I'll keep trying.
@sarimak Yes, that would be a nice feature to have. But it is not a priority for now and hence I don't think I'll get around to it anytime soon, sorry. But it may get added in the future

Here is a patch for this issue.  It works by only reformatting the number in the
amount entry field if it has changed since it was last reformatted.

Thanks for the patch!

Merged the patch. Can someone confirm that this issue is fixed in the latest release?
