title:Missing currency from Cuba

In Cuba we use two currencies, right now only one is reflected in GnuCash Android version, which is the CUP (Cuban Peso)
The missing one is the: CUC (Cuban Convertible Peso). This could be easily added to the current strings.xml file.
Could you add it please? Thanks in advance.
This currency is available and is called "Peso Convertible" in the
currencies list.
I can update the name to Cuban Convertible Peso if that's what most users
would expect to find.

Updating the name would be awesome, there are several countries in our area using a currency named "Peso" so it is too generic. I would also suggest you to change the symbols for the Cuban Peso from CU to CUP. At the end would be:
CUP = Cuban Peso
CUC = Cuban Convertible Peso
Thanks a lot!
PS: I don't know if commenting on closed issues will show up in your queue. I'll give this a while and after that try to make this get to you.
