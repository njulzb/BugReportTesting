title:Default accounts not using default currency

Creation of default accounts does not follow the set default currency. It always creates them in pounds.
I had the same problem.
Gnucash:  1.3.3
Steps to reproduce:
Expected behaviour:
Any account created after Default Currency is changed, should use the Default Currency setting.
This is not occuring.

The default accounts do no follow your default currency. They follow the currency of your locale.
I will consider this for a future release.

Looking at the issues I opened up, if you fix issue #169, then this becomes redundant doesn't it ?

Agreed.
Closing since @codinguser also agreed on #169 over this.

The person that reported this to me has a locale for Australia, yet the accounts were using USD, rather than AUD.  I presume the locale is set according to the value for "System Language" in Language & Keyboard.  This was set to English (Australia) for the person.
Should I open a new issue, or should this one be re-opened ?

No need to reopen this. A fix for #169 will cover this.
