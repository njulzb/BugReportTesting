title:New scheduled transaction like an existing one

Hi, All,
I have a scheduled transaction for my home loan repayment (of course). I receive a letter from the bank saying that from a date two months away, my monthly repayment will change. So what I want to do is change the existing scheduled transaction so that it stops when appropriate and create a new one that starts the month later.
So, I place the cursor on one of the past transactions and click on the button,"create a scheduled transaction ... ". But, instead of creating a new one, it wants to edit the old one.
Now, of course I don't want to create a new transaction from scratch. The "create" button is just too easy. The only work around I have found is to go to a similar transaction several years ago, one, I suppose, not created by the existing scheduled transaction. Then the system does create a new scheduled transaction.
This isn't a big deal. It just doesn't work the way I expected it to.
Cheers
Peter
I think this is also an issue for GnuCash desktop.
