title:Cursor position problem in amount field

The cursor is always moved to the end of the field during transaction's amount editing.
Reproduction steps:
Current behavior: The cursor is moved to the end of the number deleting ciphers in front of it while typing.
Expected behavior: The cursor stays in place while typing without replacing existing ciphers..
This is actually by design.

Create new transaction with amount e.g. 1,234.56 and save it
Open the transaction again and try to change or delete any cipher

Hi,
Is there any particular reason, i.e. use case, for this strange behavior?

The reason is different formatting formats for money amounts for different countries and also support for different number of decimal places (or the lack thereof).
So amount input is taken in from the right and then formatted according to the user locale. Deletion also occurs from the right too.

Well, the formatting itself is clear, but not understand why the cursor should change its position and why deleting occurs from the end.
For example, the formatting logic could be fired on onTextChanged event while the cursor stays in place, i.e. remember its position and restore it after the change.
Or I'm missing something?

Guys, I have another problem: gnucash doesnt let to manipulate cursor in ANY field. So if I want to edit a description of a transaction I should retype it entirely.
Is it a variation of this problem, or should I file a new bug?
This is most similar place I found for my issue.

@searoso you mean this happens for you not just in the account field, but in all other text fields as well?
