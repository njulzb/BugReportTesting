title:Positive expenses and negative income

Hi There!
I'm really confused about the ability of the Expenses account to be profitable.
I debited a charge to my Cash in Wallet sub account (say $15) then I would credit it to the Expenses:Book account but now the expenses account is considered positive cash flow

and now Expenses showing up as a profit.

It is extremely confusing.
Similarly, is possible to make the Income account negative.
I suggest to make the Income account always positive and the Expenses account always negative.
It is following the accounting principles described here: http://www.gnucash.org/docs/v2.4/C/gnucash-guide/basics-accounting1.html
Look at it this way. If you buy a book for $15, your expenses increase by $15 while your Assets:Current Account decreases by $15
This is also how the desktop version of GnuCash works.

I glanced over that docs.
But there are some exceptions to the general concept. http://www.gnucash.org/docs/v2.4/C/gnucash-guide/accts-types1.html#accts-gc-ie2
So in these special income accounts, when you transfer money from (credit) the income account to another account, the balance of the income account increases. For example, when you deposit a paycheck and record the transaction as a transfer from an income account to a bank account, the balances of both accounts increase.
Why not do something similar for expenses? At least make expenses always red.

The app already does that.
The movement of the balance of an account (increase or decrease) caused by
a split depends on the account type. Expense accounts have a debit normal
balance. That means splits which are debits cause the Expense balance to go
up, and those which are credits cause the balance to go down.
So yes, if you do a transfer between two accounts with opposite normal
balances (e.g. one credit, the other debit), both accounts could
potentially go up or down.
I understand that this is a departure from the simple debits are red and
credits are green which the app has been using until now. But as the goal
of this app is to be a companion to the GnuCash app, it is better for both
to work similarly.
You could edit your Expense account and change the account type to
something like CREDIT or INCOME, if you really want the balances to be
shown in red.
