I created two books with two GnuCash verions with default accounts and a couple transactions with USD currency and imported both into GnuCash-Android. The 2.6 version worked (imported as USD), and the 2.7 did not (imported as XXX).
If you run a diff (diff -Naur <(zcat 2.6.15-base.gnucash) <(zcat 2.7.3-base.gnucash)) on the files, you'll notice (aside from guid/date differences) <cmdty:space>ISO4217</cmdty:space> has been replaced with <cmdty:space>CURRENCY</cmdty:space>. I have attached the diff and both files.
It looks like 2.7.3 introduces breaking changes:
Their news page mentions these breaking changes on their Update Notes page, but I can't seem to access that page at the moment.
Under my system, the import does not work either. The same procedure. I tested with EUR.

It seems that they replaced ISO4217 with CURRENCY.
All instances of ISO4217 in current master excluding .gnucash and .xml files:

There is one place in GncXmlHandler.java that influence import of new format for currency. I made some fixes in #779 and it seems like working for me and can import from new and old files.

Fixed in develop via #779
