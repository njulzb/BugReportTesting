title:Confusing names in the list of currencies

Hi, I've noticed that the Bosnian Convertible Mark (BAM) is missing in the list of currencies. As the list of currencies is not editable, there is no way to use this currency.
I've just noticed that some currencies have a country in the name but others don't. I've found Convertible Mark and Forint currencies. However, the naming is a bit confusing. Perhaps, adding the currency codes (+ sorting) would make things easier. Just a suggestion.
Currencies are now sorted by country codes when creating an account.
