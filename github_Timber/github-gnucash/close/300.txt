title:Account balance should show real-time balance (and ignore future transactions)

Some transactions may be saved with a timestamp in the future. These should be ignored when computing the account balance. The transaction timestamp is set by the user.
There are always the created_at and modified_at timestamps in the db (develop) which we can lookup for other purposes.
@fefe982 could you look into this? Thanks
OK. No problem.
