title:If an export through "Sharing" is cancelled, the transaction are still deleted

If I try to export, but then change my mind (go back without exporting because I do not see the application I am looking for) all transactions are deleted. I have selected that all transactions should be deleted, but this should happen only if the export is successful.
Steps to reproduce:
The transactions will be deleted but no application will have received the file.
The data is not totally lost, really. It can be restored from the backup in the folder org.gnucash.android/backups/. The exported transactions can also be found in the folder org.gnucash.android/exports/. These folders should be in the internal storage of the device.
Received through User Voice.
This is an important one. But I can't think of an easy fix, since we do not get feedback from the third-party apps.
One way would be to make a simple undo button which can be displayed once the user returns to the app. Then we hold restore the last backup.
But it still feels inelegant and doesn't really solve the problem.

Ok, I see. I'll try to think some solution.

It just occurred to me that we always make a backup before exporting.
I'll add an article to the knowledgebase in UserVoice explaining how to recover data. Users can see those in the Help section.
Also, if you have any guides or help articles, let me know and we can publish them there too.

Yes, I've been thinking about writing some help, but never find the time...

I added a help topic explaining how to recover data from backups.
That should suffice for now
