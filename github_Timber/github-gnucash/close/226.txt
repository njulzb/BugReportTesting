title:Set the date to export transactions from (set exporting period)

Occurrence:
Sometimes the application fails to export “last transactions” (gives zero-length QIF on output).
Consequences:
As the result there is only one way to get data to PC: export "All transactions" (it could be a long period!!) and mark many hundreds transactions as duplicates (during importing to PC app) to import one hundred of new one.
Solution:
It would be perfect to get possibility to set up the date to export from in Export dialog.
hmm, I thought this issue was fixed. What version of the app are you on?
I also like your idea of exporting transactions from a particular date. Have to give it some more thought to see if it covers all our use-cases.
@fefe982 what do you think of this? Instead of the exported flag, we could just store the last export timestamp and then export everything else that was created/modified after that.
Of course we will need a created_at and maybe modified_at timestamp for all tables in the db which will be automatically updated but I was planning on adding it anyways.

Well, I cannot figure out the exact reason why the zero-length QIF is generated. And lot of fixes made recently are not added to v1.4.3 , including the new QIF export code.
I suggested export by date once myself, in response to some other issue. But at that time, I meant to use the user-entered transaction time. Adding time stamps is also a good idea.
And also redo last export (this may not help in this case, as the file in internal storage may be also empty).

It is impossible to find out exact reason: I got the problem on different versions and sometimes right after upgrading the app with non-exported transactions. Furthermore, I can suggest that the issue depends more on the place to export to: overfilled internal storage or SD-card, buggy KDE Connect, fails in OwnCloud db and so on.
Every transaction have an exported flag which is dropped after export finish, am I right? So there is no any way to export transactions with the creation date I need, until you will implement the subject?
