title:Double Entry Accounting - Implementation

Questioning GNUCash for Android's implementation of Double Entry Accounting.
GNUCash documentation explains "Accountants record increases in asset, expense, and equity accounts on the debit (left) side, and they record increases in liability, revenue, and capital accounts on the credit (right) side. GnuCash follows this convention in the register."
In GNUCash for Android when I deposit my pay (income) in my checking account (asset) my pay balance increases by crediting and my checking account balance decreases by debiting.
In GNUCash on my PC  when I deposit my pay (income) in my checking account (asset) my pay balance increases by crediting and my checking account balance increases by debiting.
Can this discrepancy be explained?
Glenn
No it cannot be explained. Will be improved.
GnuCash Android started on a very simple model of debit goes down, credit
goes up.
With time I am upgrading these legacy options to properly use the
accounting principles.
