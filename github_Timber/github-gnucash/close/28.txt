title:GNUChash cannot detect encoding in new version of OFX file  (my comment in issue #16)

Hi, recently I reported incorrect encoding detection problem upon OFX import still exists (my commnent in issue #16), seems nobody noticed...
So I repost it here:
Hi!
Today I've made apk from latest develop and tried export OFX and import.
Suppose fix didn't resolve problem... GnuCash cannot understand encoding (version 2.4.11 too).
I dug more about OFX file format and found out this:
Old version of OFX header was a set of parameters as I wrote in previous post including "ENCODING:UTF-8",
new version has only several required params and another syntax (that one you use):
And parameter ENCODING="UTF-8" hasn't to be there and should be ignored by software.
So, latest changes should be rolled back :(. Sorry.
Idea is xml header () already has encoding information.
Only way I can make Gnucash show correct encoding is to add old OFX version header part "ENCODING:UTF-8" in the very beginning of OFX.
It seems problem is in Gnucash, I'll try inform developers.
But only as walk-around is it possible add old styte header in OFX?
As you said, this is probably something to be looked at on the GnuCash desktop side.
But can you please explain some more what you mean by "add old OFX version header part "ENCODING:UTF-8" in the very beginning of OFX."
Where do you add it exactly and what version of the OFX header format do you use in that case?

Insert string "ENCODING:UTF-8" into the beginning of a file. This makes exported OFX readable for desktop GnuCash.

Example:
I see. But then it becomes neither valid OFX nor XML.

I suppose you generate OFX file only for importing it in GnuCash...
After inserting code "ENCODING:UTF-8" I can import OFX file with no problem.
Also previous version OFX header has notation like I described in issue #16  i.e. without XML tags... not sure this will breake OFX and make it invalid.
Why not apply workaround while GnuCash cannot correctly parse XML encoding tag?

I would rather not sacrifice the OFX conformity & validity. It seems strange because I could import the OFX files with no problem. I will test it again
