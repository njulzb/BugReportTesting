title:BYN currency support not stable

rivaldi8
This currency isn't supported by Java until the latests releases (see this OpenJDK bug report). It seems it's possible to add new currencies, but only from Java 7 onwards.
One possibility would be to use Joda-Money. It supports BYN and can be easily extended to support any new currency. It's not API stable yet, so we should check other alternatives first.
We should also avoid crashes in these situations.
By the way, Joda-Money also provides a Money class which we could evaluate to replace ours.

This is can (and probably should) be fixable. We now use our own commodities and if I recall correctly, @rivaldi8 you once did some cleanup to use only our Commodities instead of java Currency.
Maybe there is some place where Currency is still used. If we change it to commodity, this issue should be fixed. BYN was added to the commodities a while back I think, although I don't recall if only to new installations or also for existing ones. The latter case can easily be fixed with a database migration.

About Joda-Money, well, it is still evolving. If they get to a 1.0 at some point we can evaluate it.
Although I'm beginning to have increasing inertia to new libraries as we have quite a few already. Build time keeps going up and the apk  is starting to hit the 65k method limit in the develop branch.

Ok, I was convinced that Commodity worked on top of Currency internally. Now I see that's not the case. After quick look at uses of Currency, it seems they could be handled by Commodity. I'll work then on finishing the migration.

@shrddr @rivaldi8 is this issue fixed in v2.1.5?
I recall having to make some adjustments for BYN in that release

@codinguser I have v2.1.5 and it seems that BYN is supported now (at least for importing data from gnucash for desktop)

@codinguser The issues reported here seem to be fixed now. There are still a few uses of Currency which may make the application crash, though. I hope to finish the migration to Commodity shortly.

I've just finished the migration to Commodity.
