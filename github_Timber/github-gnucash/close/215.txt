title:Choosing the Correct "Transfer Account" for a transaction.

I exported my accounts out of GnuCash Desktop and imported them into GnuCash Android
The problem I had: Choosing the Correct "Transfer Account" for a transaction.
I go to the supermarket
After paying I go to enter the transaction in GnuCash.
In GnuCash Android I I go to
Liabilities: Tom's Visa
Add transaction:
What I need is "Expenses: Groceries". Why don't I find that?
Is it a problem with just scrolling down the list? I can't scroll down.
If I begin by going to
"Expenses: Groceries"
I still can't choose credit card
Here I see many accounts but not the "Liabilities: Tom's Credit Card" that I'm looking for.
I see:
What do you think the problem is? I really want to get this working.
I'm using two currencies, could that be what's messing this up?
Two currencies now will cause problems now. Transactions involving multiple currencies is not supported yet, the when selecting a transfer account, the two account must have the same currency.
If your "Expenses: Groceries" and Credit card account do not use the same currency, you will not be create transactions between them.

Okay, so my Expense Accounts are in USD. But I have a couple of bank accounts in ILS. My work around (which I'm trying) is to create an Expense Account in ILS named "_Fake ILS Expense". I want to move the transaction from my phone to my desktop. Once it's on the Desktop I can correct the expense account part.
I created "_Fake ILS Expense" on GnuCash Desktop.
Deleted all accounts on GnuCash Android.
Exported GnuCash Desktop accounts as QIF
Imported to GnuCash Android.
