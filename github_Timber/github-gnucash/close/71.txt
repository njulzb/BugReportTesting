title:Adding Expense accounts

In adding accounts (Build Version 1.1.2,) only the Assets account is shown as a possible parent account.  This seems odd for an app used to track expenses.
Does your Assets account have a different currency from the other accounts
(which is the same as the currency you selected for the new account)?

Thanks.  I just took another look, and the only account that allows a parent other than Assets, is Assets.  In other words:
Expenses only allows Assets as  parent.
Income only allows Assets as a parent.
New accounts only allow Assets as a parent.
Assets allows Expenses as a parent.

I'm having difficulties reproducing this. Are you certain that the checkbox is activated?
You need to click on the checkbox near the parent accounts in order to be able to select a parent account. By default, the checkbox is deactivated, meaning the account you create will be a top-level account.
Although you see the Assets account (they are alphabetically listed), it is greyed out and not active.
Check this again and confirm, thanks.
