title:Toolbar Icons I'd Love to Have

Could you explain a bit more what you mean?
There are icons for deleting splits in the split editor and you can edit scheduled transactions as well already.

Hi, Ngewi,
The split editor? What's that? Ah, now I see that when I am in a split, the Delete icon deletes that split. But, of course, it's the same icon as for deleting the whole transaction when I am in an unsplit transaction. Only just now, for the first time did I hold my mouse over the icon and read the pop-up text. Thanks, now OK with that one.
To edit existing scheduled transactions, I have to click Actions, Scheduled Transactions, Scheduled Transaction Editor. Is there a quicker way to open the Scheduled Transaction Editor?
Peter

Thanks, Ngewi,
Didn't realise I was in the Android forum.
