title:Unable to Sync with Google Drive

I may just be doing it wrong, but I figured I'd ask here.
I currently am using both the Desktop version and decided to use the Android version as well today. My current book is stored in XML. I copied my gnucash data to a folder on Google Drive, and I've verified that it is syncing between devices. I can open it on the Android app just fine, and add additional transactions, but those transactions aren't reflected when I open it on the Desktop version. I have enabled Google Drive Sync in the Backup Preferences menu, and allowed it to run on my Google account. I have set the Default Export Format to XML, and have enabled Export all transactions.
When I make a change or add a transaction, I see it reflected in the application. It does not seem to automatically sync. If I select the Export option in the Transactions section of the menu and select Google Drive as the Export Destination, I see that it has connected to Google, and it says Exported to: Google Drive -> GnuCash. However, I don't see any new or modified files in my Google Drive folder after syncing, and opening.
When I try to export to the SD card, I can't find any files added or removed that deal with GnuCash.
The Android version doesn't support working with the database of the desktop version directly.
Usually, you import your .gnucash from the desktop version into the Android one, so you have the same accounts in both applications.
Then you add transactions in the Android version as you go. From time to time, you'll export the transactions (Menu - Transactions > Export...). In your case, to Google Drive. There you should find a file named like this: `20151023_113209_gnucash_export_EUR.qif''.
Finally, you import this file into the desktop version to get the transactions introduced from the android version (File > Import > Import QIF...).
If you can't find the exported file in Google Drive, it may be due to a bug or some other problem. Which version of GnuCash are you using (Menu > Settings > About)?

@Zymus when you enable Sync in the settings, it's more like just authorizing.
To actually have the files exported on schedule, you need to export your transactions and set a recurring schedule in the dialog.
Also, the file exported will not be where the original file was saved on Google Drive, but rather in a GnuCash folder in Google Drive.
