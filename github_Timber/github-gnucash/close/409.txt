title:Error while importing the project : Create Process Error = 2

Hi All,
I am trying to import the project into my android studio. I am facing the following error.
Create Process error=2, The system cannot find the file specified
Could some one  help me rectifying this error.
That seems more like an system problem than the project.
Can you run ./gradlew build from inside the project folder?
