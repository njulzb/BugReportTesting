title:Exception thrown when click "settings" menu , on android 4.3

Version : org.gnucash.android/2.0.3-beta0 Android; 4.3;
I'm not able to reproduce it. Is it still happening with 2.0.4? Does it happen every time or just sometimes? Is the application crashing or the exception just gets logged to Logcat?
