title:Crash when enabling and setting passcode permanently locks user out.

I installed from the play store on 4.4.2.
I can repeat the bug following these steps.
If I instead go back to settings after step 7 and try to set the passcode again, the same thing happens.
I am currently just not using a passcode and everything is working, but I would like to be able to use that feature.
@aint Could you look into this?

@jordonbiondo do you still experience this on latest versions?

Sorry I don't have an android device any more to test it.
