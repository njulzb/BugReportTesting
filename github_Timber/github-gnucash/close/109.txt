title:Auto-complete for description

codinguser
Would be nice to copy the behavior of entry in desktop GNUcash, where the description auto-completes from previous transactions, and if an auto-complete result is chosen, the most recent transaction is copied into the current transaction.

It's a start. However, when a completion is selected, desktop GNUcash copies the other fields from the most recent transaction having that description, and leaves it open for editing. It's a huge data-entry time saver and would be a useful addition to your app.

That would indeed also render #45 unnecessary. I'll look into it.

As mentioned privately already: Please don't copy the date&time from the loaded transaction. This is not what is helpful during entering a new transaction, which by definition almost always needs a new date&time.
