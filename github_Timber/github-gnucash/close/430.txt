title:Too many keystrokes for value typing

Previous versions had a nice feature which allowed to just type "42" to get "0.42". Right now, I need the double amount of keystrokes, since I have to type "0.42" entirely.
The amount field now supports expressions, which means we cannot format your input in a certain way for you. Also, some currencies do not support decimal places, so the old way was rather disingenuous for those users.
I'm sorry, but we don't plan to change this at the moment.
