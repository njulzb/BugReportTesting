title:saving is slow since 1.4

codinguser
Since the update to 1.4 every save I do (add or change a transaction) takes about 10 seconds on my HTC Desire S. (1.4.3 did not fix it)
Before the update it took less than a second.
Please let me know if you need more information or if I can do some testing to help find the problem.
@nikopp what version of Android are you using? Do you have double-entry enabled?
@fefe982 interested in doing some speed magic here? ;)

Yeah, but I haven't successfully reproduced this yet ...
Will keep on.

Yes.
I've not been able to reproduce it either. Will keep trying as well.
@nikopp if there is anything else special about your setup, please let us know

For me, editing transaction is not taking too much time. However, editing Account does.

If I delete all transactions then everything (add/update) is fast again.
But that definitely changed with 1.4. Before 1.4 the performance was good
without deleting all transactions.

I just exported and deleted all transactions because it was slow again. And there were only 67 transactions.
I have 154 accounts in the tree.
Can I do something else to help you reproduce the behaviour?

Do you mean that saving starts out fast and then gets slower as you add
more transactions to the system?
Or is it always slow from the get-go?

Exactly.

No. It's fast as long as there are few transactions.

No. It's fast as long as there are few transactions.
hmm, ok, this I didn't know.
Provides some new directions to look! Thanks

Hi again,
in the meantime I got the Sony Xperia Z3 compact and the problem also appears on that phone although it's high end hardware.
Is there any progress on this issue?
Can I help somehow?

Not much, it is hard to replicate the issue and that is what is stalling progress on fixing it.
So far, my observation is that one either experiences it, or not.
We will review the code to eliminate any potential bottlenecks and hopefully that helps.

I exported all transactions and attached the qif file after replacing the
names by rather meaningless terms.
I hope that helps in finding the bug.

@nikopp is this still an issue?
@nikopp is this still an issue?
Some days ago I did an export because I noticed that it became slower again.
I will observe the behaviour and comment again in a couple of weeks.
Furthermore I noticed, that the attachment from my comment on 10 Apr was not attached to the issue because I sent it via mail and the file type is not supported.
I did the upload again as a TXT but it is in fact a QIF:
20150410_094837_gnucash_export_EUR.qif

@nikopp Another user reported this and seemed to identify the problem. It happens only when you have a homescreen widget. We will work on a fix for this

@codinguser: Thanks for the info. I indeed use widgets. But since the new
major version, the slowdown is not as significant as before.
