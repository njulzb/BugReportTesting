title:Account import fails with no explanation

I tried to import a large account structure from my desktop gnucash. The program imported a couple of entries, then failed with no explanation. The accounts already imported functioned poperly.
I would love to provide more data, but i'm not sure how (providing the structure is not an option).
The error message should give information about tbe line/entry that failed and the error encountered.
Hi,
What version of the app are you using? 1.2.0 or 1.2.1.
Please if you have 1.2.0, pleas update and try again and let me know.

Still reproducing with 1.2.2. Assuming the accounts are loaded in order, this is the one that fails:
XXXX - I changed the ID, but it exists in the file. Its entry reads:

Has the same problem with 1.2.2. Only able to import when I manually deleted all account not using real money, such as the ones with manually created currencies in "INET_VIRTUAL" space.

FWIW, same problem here with 1.2.2.  Running Android 4.1.1.  Fairly large account tree: I was importing 1MB XML file--been a gnucash user forever!

This issue should be fixed in version 1.2.3. Please confirm.

yes, was able to import the acct list successfully--generated no errors.
however, the exported transactions don't seem to have the account
information when the exported OFX file is read back into GNUcash. I get
asked to map the account "manually"
