title:Java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: accounts Record ID -9223372036854775808 does not exist in the db

Fresh install on cm-13.0-20160201-NIGHTLY-mako.zip and gnucash 2.0.5.
I've only added one account (= completely manual setup) in EUR and am trying to add my first transaction.
Naming of the accounts & altering the amount of money to book does not change anything.
Exception below.
Please let me know in case you require any help to reproduce this issue.
Thanks,
Raoul

We are aware of this issue and know how to fix it.
Coming soon, right @rivaldi8 ? ;)
@raoulbhatia By the way, are you using the app in double-entry mode or single-entry mode? If you only use one account, then you have to go to the settings and disable double-entry mode. Else you need to have at least two accounts

@codinguser i have now disabled double entry but, as you will probably know, am still seeing a crash.
Note: I created a new account after changing the setting. Happy to test  fix for this issue.
