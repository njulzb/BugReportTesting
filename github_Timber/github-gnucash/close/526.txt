title:Opening a scheduled transaction to view causes app to crash

The scheduled transaction list is displayed, but the individual items cannot be opened for editing..
This behaviour currently occurs on develop branch.
This can be fixed and extended so that tapping on a scheduled transaction does not directly go to editing it, but rather first displays details of it using TransactionDetailFragment. And then from there, it can be edited further.
The crash happens when the scheduled transaction doesn't have an end date.
When we don't set an end date, no value is stored in the corresponding field in the database. This is then read as a null value in RecurrenceDbAdapter.buildModelInstance into ScheduledAction.mRecurrence.mPeriodEnd, which provokes a NullPointerException in Recurrence.getCount().
