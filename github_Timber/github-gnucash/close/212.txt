title:Currency for app settings not from the system settings when creating default account

I have set my system to English UK language and in the App I have set € as currency. When creating the default accounts I get £ as currency, but I want € like set in the App settings.
Sorry, at the moment, the created default accounts do not use the default
currency setting.
We hope to improve this in future versions.
