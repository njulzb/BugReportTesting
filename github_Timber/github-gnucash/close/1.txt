title:Opening a transaction shows value divided by 10

codinguser
When opening a transaction from the list, the value of the transaction shown on the edit page has been divided by 10.
Using a Samsung Galaxy S3, Android 4.0.4
Occurres only, if two digits (1.8) are entered. In case there are 3 digits (1.81) the amount is displayed properly. Has something to do with NumberFormat.getCurrencyInstance().format((parsed / 100)); in NewTransactionFragment -> afterTextChanged()
