title:Allow to enter amount in "calculator" style

Current implementation of entering amounts is very unconvinient for currencies where fraction values does not matter mostly. For now to enter that i've spent 250 RUB I need to enter 2, 5, 0 and then add 2 zeroes to pad value with zeroes that fills fraction part.
Input style where fraction part occurs when I explicitly enter "dot" or "comma" like with calculator is more natural and efficient (at least for some currencies): just hit 2, 5, 0 and if it some fraction part (which is seldom) add "dot" and fraction.
Maybe it's doubtful if it is worth to fully replace current implementation, but at least it would be great to have an option to select the way of entering numbers.
Yes, the plan is to improve this particular aspect in the future and use decimals for currencies that need it. A calculator for inputing amounts might also be added. Thanks for the feedback!

#19 is not the same. I'm requesting just change in UX of entering values, it does not include ability to perform arithmetic operations.
To be more strict you can treat #19 as more broader feature request.
