Search in account list should ignore case.

This is an issue with non-ascii characters. In case anyone is reading this, suggestions to fix this are welcome.

I followed the steps above on Android 6.0.1 and failed to reproduce the issue.
It looks like it was fixed in Android 5.0. See https://issuetracker.google.com/36918562#comment11.
