title:Cannot edit transactions

Using 1.4.2 on Android 4.4.2 (Droid Razr MAXX HD).
Also not using the Double Entry.
Previously to the latest update to 1.4.2, I could easily pull in previous transactions to edit them as new.and then edit the amounts. That no longer works, I am not able to edit the dollare amount until I exit the transaction. Then, when I go into the transaction to edit the amount, the edited amount gets added tot he transaction instead of the transaction being changed.
Steps to duplicate.
Reverting to 1.3.3 solves this problem. Can edit historical transactions when creating new without error.

I cannot see it in the Play Store for some reason. Where can I get it as a download? It's not showing up here:

I updated the link with the release on GitHub.

1.4.3 fixes the edit problem. The column names are still backwards, but that's another Issue.
Thanks!
