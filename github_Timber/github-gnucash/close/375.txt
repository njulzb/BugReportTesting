title:the same database for desktop and android

Hi all,
Obviously it should be discussed somewhere before but I was unable to find it :-/
Suggestion: make android app able to use the same data file as desktop version. This would let to live without exports/imports, just synchronization of data file (e.g. using cloud).
Yeah, you're right, this has been discussed a lot previously in several issues here on GitHub.
Unfortunately, it's not going to be happening any time soon due to feature incompatibility between the apps, and also to avoid data corruption

gnucash  database sqlite/postgress/mysql  + symmetric-ds  <-SYNC->  gca compiled w/ symmetric-ds android jars

This is almost possible now, if you do an XML export and overwrite the gnucash file you imported, you basically get this. Just need an option to save to a particular file instead of also to an app-specific directory.
