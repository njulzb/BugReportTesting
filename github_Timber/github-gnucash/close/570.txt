title:Include whitespace in XML file just like desktop app

Diff of XML export against source file should show differences between the way both apps save data + new transactions usefully.
Everything in the android export is on a single line, making the diff useless.
Already implemented in develop branch (9af8b19). Not sure how well the unmodified parts will be preserved in relation with the desktop version.
