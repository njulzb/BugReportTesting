title:OFX file generated with incorrect account type

Possibly linked to #100 , I'm having trouble importing transactions from GnuCash Android to Desktop v 2.4.11.
I exported an accounts file and GCA created the correct account structure, but then when I tried to create an OFX file of transactions to import back into the Desktop version it told me the accounts were unrecognized and I had to manually select them.
I suspect this is because the account type is being set incorrectly in the OFX file.
For example, the details of one of the accounts was:
But the transaction I created in Android got exported as:
As you can see, it is supposed to be an expense account, but was instead marked as a CHECKING account even though the ID is correct.
The account type is right according to the OFX standard which has different
types from GnuCash.
The problem is that GnuCash does not match the account IDs when importing
from OFX. Otherwise it would detect and match the accounts properly using
the IDs.
I am working on enabling QIF import which should make matching better. Stay
tuned

For anyone wanting to work around this in the mean time, I have a Python script that will insert the matching account IDs into a gnucash xml file at https://gist.github.com/davidfraser/7095779
