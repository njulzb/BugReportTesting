title:Saving new transaction crashes app

codinguser
Steps:
App immediately crashes, and from here on, app keeps crashing as soon as it is opened, until I clean its data.
Details: Nexus S, Jelly Bean, Brazilian Real (currency), installed from F-Droid.
Hi kepler,
Thanks for the report. Unfortunately I cannot replicate it. It sounds very similary to #3 which was fixed some commits ago. Are you sure you are on the latest beta?

Then that is really strange. I'll check again.

Kepler, do you have a dev environment setup? Can you capture the log output and send to me?

I now know why I could not replicate this issue. It was fixed post-beta, specifically in commit 529479f
Thanks for posting though. I'll close this now.

Great! I'll wait for the next beta, then. Thanks.
