title:Entering new transaction fails in 1.5.3

With 1.5.3 and double-entry activated, entering a new transaction (in completely empty accounts) fails. After pressing "Save", the new transaction just vanishes and is nowhere visible.
When de-activating double-entry, everything works fine. This is on android 4.4.4, , Sony xperia z1 compact.
Also, in version 1.5.2, the entering of new transactions probably worked fine, but my memory might also trick me. For sure in version 1.5.1 all worked fine.
Thanks for reporting this.
I am at a loss because I've had a few reports of this, but cannot replicate it.
I have tried with both double-entry enabled and disabled, with no luck.
Maybe it could be something that carries over from upgrades since I am constantly reinstalling as part of the dev process. I'll keep trying to find out what is happening.
Maybe can you give me an example of the account types involved and I can try to exactly replicate your environment. I tried with some simple account types and everything worked

Confirming, happens to me as well.
Steps:
Android 4.4.2
Just checked with default accounts: records are created. So I think it has something to do with the case when there is just 1 account.

The bug can be reproduced with @relgames 's procedure.
It is because there's no valid account for the other split in the new created transaction, so the creation of the transaction fails.
The valid transfer accounts are queried in the DB in TransactionFormFragment.updateTransferAccountsList() .
I think a warning should be added when the user tries to create a new transaction in a account but no valid transfer account can be found. Or create an Imbalance account if no valid transfer account is found.

Checked with 1.5.2 - no issue.
