title:Restoring backup from QIF file : Not well-formed

I get the error At line 1, column 0: not well-formed when importing a backup from a QIF file into GnuCash Android (file was generated using same app but maybe different version).
Sample from QIF file.
Also a small suggestion: while exporting to QIF, the user should be told that the timings of the transactions will not be saved.

Oh, okay. Could you please add that as a comment while exporting, maybe as a small alert to the user displayed in orange or red?
