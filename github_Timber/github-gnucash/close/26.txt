title:Allow empty description

codinguser
HI,
NIce work with the GnucashMobile!
I started using it yesterday with the release candidate.
I noticed that a transaction can not be entered if the description field is empty.
I think it would be nice to allow this field by empty in order to enter transactions faster
Thanks
This is a good point. I will consider changing this to allow for empty
description/name of the transaction.
Only an amount should be required.
