title:Split support

I need to keep track of sales taxes, especially for out-of-state purchases. Would be nice for the transaction view to support splits. Of course work would be required on the export side as well.
The idea of a GNUcash companion for entering transactions to be imported on the desktop is a good one, but without splits I just can't use it that much. I guess I could type extra information in the note and edit it when I get to the desktop, but that's not a terribly satisfying workaround.
The thing is that right now only OFX export is supported. And OFX does not support splits.
Until we have support for an export format which can handle splits, implementing split transactions will be put on hold.
