title:Don't ask for permissions that you don't need

As soon as I complete the setup wizard, GnuCash asks for permission to access my sdcard, and if I deny it continues to nag me every time I open it. There is no reason to ask for this permission unless I choose to import or export data.
This is because GnuCash Android backs up internally to the SD card several times during operation.
Before delete operations, exports etc. These are saved to the SD card so that if something goes wrong, you can always recover your data with no issues.
So yeah, we need the SD card permission for proper functioning of GnuCash
