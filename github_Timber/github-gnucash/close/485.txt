title:Export to Google Drive not working on Marshmallow

I upgraded my Nexus 5 from CM12 to CM13, and just tried my first export of data. All the same notices appear (i.e. the "...exported to Google Drive GnuCash..." folder, or whatever it says, and I get no errors from the app, but the exported QIF is no where to be found. Fortunately, I don't let the app delete the transactions, so I still have them, but...
Having used CM13 for a couple of weeks now (and I fully admit I'm neither a dev nor a programmer) I suspect it's probably a permissions issue of some sort. I've had several of those, where apps don't notify me of the new Marshmallow permissions that are needed, and so fail without any seeming cause.
Anyway... You're now informed. :)
I had a similar problem. I debugged a lot and finally my Drive history saved me - the app was creating a file indeed, but it was creating in a Gnucash folder which was in the bin (google drive bin). I restored the folder, merged the already existing previous folder and everything was good. I also use CM13 on my OnePlus One.

That doesn't sound good at all.  Rest assured we're working on fixes for
the file export and sync.
Thanks for your feedback!

dhwaneetbhatt -- Thank you for that! I also discovered that export to DropBox (still?) works fine, so I've been using that. I haven't had a chance to look into your Drive solution yet, though. I'll go do that now and report back here.
Cheers!

Okay... Well... Upon further review, I have no "bin" folder anywhere in Google Drive. I do still have the GnuCash folder than the app originally created, which is the first place I looked when I discovered that it wasn't actually exporting the QIF file into the folder after  the CM13 upgrade. So... That's what I know.

I'm having the same issue on an asus zenphone2.
It's using android 6.0.1

I have this issue as well. Worked great once upon a time, however nothing shows up in my google drive. The expert seems like it is working by saying it is connected to google drive and exporting gnucash -> google drive, but nothing is there.
I deleted the GnuCash folder in Google drive thinking a new one would be created...it hasn't yet.
Thanks for your time and this great product.

@zutroy97 and @scompo Try emptying your Google Drive bin and export again. In my case the file was getting created even if the folder was present in bin.

I didn't find a "bin" folder. Is that the same as "Trash?"
At any rate, I set up a scheduled export. After a few days I noticed 3 GnuCash folders in gDrive. How is that possible?
One of them contained all the exports. I deleted the other two (which had no entries.)
Seems to be working now, I have no idea what changed or what I did to "fix" it.
Thank You for your response.

Deleting the folder from the trash solved the problem, now it's working for me.

Hey guys,
@dhwaneetbhatt your suggestion is correct. For some reason, Google Drive identifies a folder as existing even if it is in the trash. So the exports keep going there.
@zutroy97 Sometimes multiple folders get created due to the way it is implemented at the moment. This could be fixed, I think, but it's not trivial and so we just haven't gotten around to it.
We hope to make major overhauls to Google Drive integration in the long term using the Storage Access Framework.

For those still not getting the files exported to Google Drive, are you using multiple currencies?

This request is made irrelevant by #646  which is implemented in 8ad3e04
Backups will in the future go through the SAF, which is more robust and affords more flexibility
