title:Widgets stop functioning after changing book

czan
The widget continues to display the account it was created with.
The widget displays "Account name" and one button which does nothing (there are two buttons if this is done on the develop branch). Clicking on the widget also does nothing.
If you re-open Book 1 and restart your device the widget will return to displaying the correct account.
I've taken a look at the code, and the configuration saving/restoring needs to be rewritten. It's currently stored in the SharedPreferences for the account's book, but then if/when the widget is updated it tries to read the active book's SharedPreferences. We can solve this by either
I have a slight preference for the second option, but the first is more similar to the current implementation.
Unless I'm missing some easy way to get the book associated to a widget, I agree with using the second option. Although I'd rather like to have a widget's preferences stored along with its book, it seems it would unnecessarily complicate the code.
@codinguser What do you think?

@rivaldi8 I'm fine with the second option. The implementation in #608 also looks cleaner than before.
Thanks @czan .

@rivaldi8 how about we just move this to v2.2.0?
The patch depends on changes already made for hiding balances, etc.

@codinguser Ok, moved to 2.2.0.
