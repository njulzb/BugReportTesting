title:What's the proper to import selected transactions from desktop to Android app?

I 'm trying to sync recent transactions from desktop to Android app. I tried to use [save as] function in desktop version to export transactions to Android app but found that all transactions were imported into a new book but not the one existed. I've also tried to [export] recent transactions into a CSV file but failed to import into the app. There is an error which said syntax error.
GnuCash Android does not support importing from CSV. Only GnuCash XML files can be imported
