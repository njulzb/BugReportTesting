title:Allow changing smallest currency fraction

It seems all currencies are being displayed with two decimal places. There should be a setting for changing this behavior, or even better, autodetect the correct number of decimal places based on the selected currency (Gnucash on the desktop does this by default).
This would be great especially because the space for entering transaction amounts doesn't fit numbers greater or equal than 10,000.00 on my screen, which isn't a lot on my (non fractional) currency.
This is true. This is planned to be fixed eventually
