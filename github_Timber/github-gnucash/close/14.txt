title:Bump version code more often

F-droid has beta 1 of this app, but can't include beta 2 because the version code hasn't changed. F-droid plans to include different apks with the same version code but that won't happen for a while yet,
I hear you. But the version code will only be bumped once the app goes
final. And only for subsequent stable releases.
Sorry for any inconvenience.
