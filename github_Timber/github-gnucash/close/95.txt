title:New release 1.2.0 crash when cilck on 'settings'

Hello,
I've just update to the new release of gnucash-android and checking new options I've seen that every time I try to open settings, the app crash. Everytime.
I use a Samsung Galaxy Mini 2 (GT-S6500D) running Androind 2.3.6
Oops, will look into it.

Tested on a Samsung Galaxy Mini (GT-S5570) with Android 2.3.6 (GINGERBREAD.XWKTS), rooted.
Same crash doing the same.
