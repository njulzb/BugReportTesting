@codinguser I'm assuming here, as stated in Split's javadoc, that splits always have positive amounts. However, there are some places where it seems it allows negative amounts (example), which is confusing. If you could confirm that my assumption is right, I'll change all this code to assume positive amounts instead.

@rivaldi8 yes, you are correct in your assumption.
Splits should always be positive, and the type determines the effect of the split.
