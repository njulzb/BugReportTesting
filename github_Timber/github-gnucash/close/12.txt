title:Transaction Dates aren't compatible with Gnucash

Exporting transactions in OFX format and import into Gnucash results in nonsensical date fields. See here: http://d.pr/i/WidR (All values are fake, just for testing, but it demonstrates the problem.)
The 'Opening Balance' and 'Shopping' transaction were added to Gnucash first. Then I created some transactions in GnucashMobile, and exported/imported them into Gnucash. They are then shown at the top because of the issue with dates.
Yes, dates were not being exported in the transactions. This has been fixed in commit c63c91d in the develop branch.

According to the OFX example and the OFX spec PDF, each STMTTRN tag should have a DTPOSTED tag, which GnucashMobile doesn't seem to do currently.
I'll have a look at it fixing it, unless this is done on purpose?

Awesome, I'll make a build and test.

Works perfectly. Are you going to release a built apk with that commit included soon?
