title:unable to export

I'm running gnucash-android 1.1.2 on Android 4.1.2 on a Samsung I9000.
I cannot export to OFX. I have tried exporting to SD card, or "share file" without success. I tried to check "Export all transaction" but to no avail.
Expected behaviour:
Export the OFX file
What's the default path it tries to export to?
Maybe its a permission issue?
What can I do to troubleshoot this?
Turns out my sdcard was full. After reclaiming some space exporting worked, both ways.
Maybe you can catch that and present a proper error message intead of a generic one?

I'm glad you figured it out. It will indeed be nice to give a better error
message in the future.
