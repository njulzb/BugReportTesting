title:NumberFormatException with big amount transaction

codinguser
Hi,
I was trying the Alpha 2 and crash occurs when I entered a new transaction with 1047,00 €. The amount is not that important but it seem to produce overflow or something like this.
Here the call stack :

Also I runned it on Froyo (2.2).
Thanks
Thanks for the report and the log. I have however not been able to replicate the bug. The only way I can currently get it to crash is if I input a minus (-) as the very first input in the amount field. I am working on a fix for this. Maybe you hit the minus key by error? Can you please verify whether the crash happens when you actually press a number key?

Just pushed a commit. Sync your repo and let me know if this is fixed for you. Thanks

After pulling, setup ant and test here the result : I can't add anymore debit transaction.
When I enter a debit transaction, when I apply it, it is automatically transformed in credit.
Anyway, large number no more cause crash.

Can you please provide me with some additional information?
What hardware are you using?
What locale are you using?
I am guessing you are running Android 2.2?

Multiple select from transaction table while I was editing an existing transaction in account. I have first entered it as Debit, but it is displayed as Credit when you look at your account.
Here is what I have done :
Also tested on ICS, local US, acount in EUR, the behavior is the same.
Hope it helps.

Confirmed, I can now replicate this. Thank you for the detailed info. I am working on it.

Can you please sync your repo and try again. I think I fixed it this time.

Thanks, this is well working now !
I really would like to contribute to this app, but i don't know how exactly for now. What about opening translation, or whatever you think as I have little Java/Android skills ?
Thanks for your work.

Thanks for your work.
Thanks for your interest in helping.
For now, it is just bug fixing and code scrubbing and refactoring for the
next 2-3 weeks.
After that, translation will probably begin. What language can you
translate to?
The other potential area will be contributing tests to cover various
scenarios. GnucashMobile uses Robotium for tests. So you could start
looking into the framework in preparation for when contributions open.
Thanks again.
Cheers,
