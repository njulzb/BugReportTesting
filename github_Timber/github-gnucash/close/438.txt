title:First time import does not have progress bar

Tried on develop and with newly installed App, when I chose to import my own book with the startup dialog, nothing is shown on the screen when the import is being done.
I can only check the logcat to know that the import is in progress.
Besides that everything is OK. The UI can be used.I didn't try what would happen if I try to create some accounts during import.
Don't know if this is related to #428 .
Is that because the import goes too fast to notice, or does it take some time and yet no dialog is shown?
No, it's not related to #428
