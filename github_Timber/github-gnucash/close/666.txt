title:Please add Dropbox for "Open" and OneDrive for "export"

This app can export directly to Dropbox but can't open from it. But for OneDrive is opposite.
Go to Settings -> Accounts --> Import.
You'll see Dropbox there.
For export, select export destination "Send to.." and you'll see OneDrive
Go to Settings -> Accounts --> Import.

Yeah I had the same question, and struggled to find it:
Go to Settings -> Accounts --> Import GnuCash XML --> Hamburger Menu --> Dropbox.
