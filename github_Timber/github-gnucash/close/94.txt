title:Default account structure (feature)

A good feature to implement is a default account structure. When application run first time would be helpful that app offer a default structure, novice people could not know anything about GnuCash.
This feature is given in GnuCash desktop version.
Thanks for opening this issue, I have actually given it some thought before.
There is dialog for creating default accounts when the app is opened for the first time. I think this is sufficient for most (novice) users. Those power GnuCash users probably already have an account structure on the desktop and would probably prefer to import it.

@codinguser Ok, but suppose that a nocive user dismiss accidentaly this dialog at first time, there is no way to return back and create these default accounts.
