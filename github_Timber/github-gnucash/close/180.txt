title:Transactions cannot be edited in 1.4.0

codinguser
The app was updated to 1.4.0 automatically on a LG-E460, Android 4.1.2. In the new version, I'm unable to edit any existing transaction: Every change seems to get discarded after I press "Save". Also, when the transaction quickfill is chosen during entering, the values from the quickfill get saved regardless of whether I've changed them before pressing "Save".

No, the double-entry checkbox is not activated.
I have two problems: On creating a new txn from autofill, the changed amount
is ignored. Secondly, when editing that txn later, the changed amount is still
ignored. However, I can't tell whether this second problem also occurred when
editing a non-autofill txn.
I don't think I actively used autofill when editing the transaction, only
during creating it.

I found the bug. Thanks for reporting the issue!

Unfortunately, the bug still exists: Gnucash 1.4.2 on another device, Sony Xperia Tipo with Android 4.0.4. But as before, I'm still using no double-Entry (the double-entry checkbox is deactivated). As before, I have two problems: Editing any existing transactions will ignore the changes and still have the values from before; secondly, when entering a new txn and accepting the proposed autofill, changing the value into something else is not saved but instead the value from the autofilled txn is saved.

True, it was previously fixed only when double-entry was enabled.
A new release is going into beta now, please test and let me know if it's fixed.
Thank you!
