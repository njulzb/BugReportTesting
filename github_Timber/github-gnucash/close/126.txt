title:Cannot find option to delete one transaction

Seems this option was available earlier, but now long tap on transaction does nothing.
Nexus 7 2012 with 4.4. KitKat, Gnucash 1.2.5, from GooglePlay.
Long tap on the transaction has never done anything in the app. There is a checkbox to the left of every transaction. Check it to manipulate the transaction.
Granted, the checkbox is very faint on some devices, I'll look into that.
