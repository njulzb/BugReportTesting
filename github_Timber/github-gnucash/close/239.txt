title:Reporting

Hi,
It would be useful if a user can see income and expenses for selected period of time.
Is there any plan for some kind of reporting feature?
Right now I'm working on the chart reports feature. A pie chart is almost done. With time I'm going to add a line chart and maybe a bar chart.

This looks great.
