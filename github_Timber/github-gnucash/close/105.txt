Ok. And when you say reset, do you mean it shows nothing at all and is just
blank, or does it just show
"Account name  0.00$"

I just noticed that my widget is currently showing my old balance even though I just exported and deleted all transactions. When I open the program, it shows empty account information as expected. Maybe this is related?

Thanks for the additional info @hazzl. That can be fixed and is unrelated to the main issue reported. I am still investigating.

I've seen this bug too and was able to reproduce it. The widget gets reset on a reboot.
I could not reproduce the "export causes old widget data".

If you are in the beta program, please try out v1.2.7 and let me know if the widget still resets after rebooting the phone.
Else, test it when it becomes available to all in a few days.

If no one can reproduce this bug, then I will close it soon.

I still can reproduce this bug consistently using version 1.3.3 on my RAZR D1 (original ROM).
I've been using GnuCash widget since January. Google Play is configured to update apps automatically since ever. I didn't notice this problem before rooting my phone using Framaroot a month ago.
Please, let me know if there's something I can do to help you fix it.
