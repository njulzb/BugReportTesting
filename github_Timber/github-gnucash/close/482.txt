title:Scheduled transactions are corrupted after import from .gnucash

I have many scheduled transactions that are working fine on the desktop version. However, after importing to Android, the transactions are not working as defined. If I open transaction split in the Android version one side (the Asset part) of the balance is in the Imbalance account rather than in the correct account where I find 0 instead. This way only the Expense is counted correctly but the Asset part goes to Imbalance always.
Sorry, forgot to add some screenshots. I am using GnuCash for Android version 2.0.6

Is it possible to send me the file sample which causes this problem?
You can redact all important information and send only a minimal data which would generate this problem.
