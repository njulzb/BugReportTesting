title:skip passcode input layout with SwipeBack

SwipeBack is a Xposed module that use swipe gesture to perform back operation
I'm have install both GnuCash and SwipeBack,
and found that the passcode input layout can be swiped and enter the main ui directly
I think it's a security issue

Not fully fixed in v1.5.5(from F-Droid).
This time swipe the passcode don't show main ui, the app quit out. Passcode is required if app started again.
But if I'm fast enough, that is swipe the passcode IMMEDIATELY after passcode layout shows up, I have CHANCE to enter the main ui directly at app's next start.
So after repeating the "start app -> swipe out -> app quit" loop several times, I can enter the main ui without a passcode.
