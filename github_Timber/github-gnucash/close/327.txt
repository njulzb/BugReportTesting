title:Provide UI option for dynamic switching of currency in reports

When you open the reports view, if your accounts are in a different currency from the default (can happen due to importing an GnuCash XML), no data will be shown.
If you didn't already know that there was a setting to change the currency, it can be very confusing.
It will be nice to have an option to dynamically switch the currency from within the reports view itself.
@aint could you look into this?
Of course.
Of course.
