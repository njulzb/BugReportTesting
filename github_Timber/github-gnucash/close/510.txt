title:Crash on export with Xiaomi5

I'm using 2.0.3 at the moment, with a new install.
logcat displays the following:
/data/user/0/org.gnucash.android/cache/OFX/20160621_183543_gnucash_export.ofx: open failed: ENOENT (No such file or directory)
The odd thing is that on first ever export, gnucash-android created the export folder where expected, just next to the backup folder in /sdcard/org.gnucash.android/ but apparently was not able to create the file in it.
Any idea on how to change this folder?
No, the problem is not access to the export folder on your SD card. The problem seems to be with the generation of the export file on the internal storage (before it is copied to external SD card).
@rivaldi8 this might be up your alley? Have you seen this error before?

@codinguser Yes, this looks like #448.
@nodje Upgrading to the latest version should fix the problem. Could you upgrade and check if it's fixed?

@rivaldi8 I was trying to build from source but got a problem.
A problem occurred configuring project ':app'. > Could not find actionbarsherlock.aar (com.actionbarsherlock:actionbarsherlock:4.4.0)
I don't know why I can't get this lib, maybe it has to do with my repository config. I guess this should be available from the std Maven repo, isn't it?
I'll try with 2.0.7 otherwise (I don't use Google Play and F-Droid doesn't seem to propose gnucash-android anymore, which makes it a bit difficult to get the latest app)

@nodje hmm, that's a weird error, since @rivaldi8 removed our dependency on actionbarsherlock a while back.

I close the bug since it's working with 2.0.7. Sorry about that btw, I should  have checked before posting the issue.
Just curious about why gnucash-android is not available on F-Droid repo anymore?
(And sorry with the confusion, I mistakenly checkout an older version for tag 2.0.7 no actionbarsherlock problem...)

@nodje Don't worry, it happens to me all the time :)
The application isn't in F-Droid because of some non-free dependencies. See #435 for more details.

👍 got it

@nodje if you are not interested in running the tests, skip the build
command and run only gradle installDevelopmentDebug
A quick googling suggests that the error occurs if you try to run the build
offline. Was this the case with yours?

I seem to have problem passing the tests when running gradle build
installDevelopmentDebug for reasons that are beyond my understanding

What went wrong:

A build operation failed.
Could not write XML test results for org.gnucash.android.test.unit.db.AccountsDbAdapterTest to file /Users/nodje/Documents/project/fork/gnucash-android/app/build/test-results/betaDebug/TEST-org.gnucash.android.test.unit.db.AccountsDbAdapterTest.xml.
Try:
Run with --stacktrace option to get the stack trace. Run with --info or --debug option to get more log output.
BUILD FAILED
And it takes forever for each test to fail. Any quick idea on what could
cause this?

Thanks for answering. I don't know what happened, maybe a temporary loss of connection. In any case it didn't work for a few times then suddenly started working. Then I used -x test to get rid of test, but gradle installDevelopmentDebug is even simpler.
But I've never been able to deploy the dev version on my phone alongside 2.0.7. I always get this error, for which I haven't found a solution for online.
Installing APK 'GnucashAndroid_v2.0.7-dev2_rc427f21.apk' on 'MI 5 - 6.0' for app:developmentDebug Unable to install /Users/nodje/Documents/project/gnucash-android/app/build/outputs/apk/GnucashAndroid_v2.0.7-dev2_rc427f21.apk com.android.ddmlib.InstallException: Failed to establish session
I can see my device with adb devices though.
