title:OFX export fails with FileNotFoundException

Exporting transactions in OFX format fail if there's a difference in the wall clock time between the start and end of the export.
It happens when the second call to Export.getExportCacheFilePath() in
OfxExporter.generateExport() returns a file name with a time stamp different to
the first call in the same method. The root of the problem is
getExportCacheFilePath(), which builds the file name with the current time.
Received through Crashlitics as issue #129.
I'm preparing a fix.
