title:XML Export of transactions to GDrive generates broken XML since latest version

codinguser
Transactions->Export
Save As... (file in Google Drive), Format XML
Export
Open...
Choose file from Google Drive
=> 'An error occurred while importing the GnuCash accounts At line 1, column 2: not well-formed (invalid token)'
Export and Open works, as before the latest update.
Hi, please let me share the findings regarding this issue. With version 2.2.1, the XML export is zipped, while the importer expects a plain XML file (uncompressed).
As workaround, until the bug is fixed, one can just unzip the exported file, before importing.

@m8nky Thanks for the report and the workaround. I think I have an idea where to look for the problem.
We will fix this for the next release. Normally, GnuCash Android should open even files which are gzipped.

Seems to be fixed in develop branch by c4f6a26..bd8725f.
