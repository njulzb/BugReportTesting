title:Can't write in the name field when creating a new account

codinguser
When I try to create a new account, I get the window with empty name field, the default currency /EURO in my case) and the field to pickup a parent account.
If I try to type at account name field nothing happens, but if you first choose a new currency, even if it is the default one, now you can type without problem.
Is it an expected behaviour?
my envorionment:
App version: 1.1.2
Android version: 2.3.6 (kernel 2.6.38.6-1214151 / compilation GINGERBREAD.XXLK2)
Phone model: Samsung Galaxy Mini 2 (GT-S6500D)
thanks!
No, this is not expected behaviour. I will try to investigate it.
Btw, thanks for your bug reports. Keep the feedback coming.

I don't think so because I have deactivated Swype and I still have the same
problem.
