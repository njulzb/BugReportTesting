GnuCash Android since v2.2.0  does not have permission to read from any location on the SD card.
I would suggest going through the Navigation Drawer --> Open and then select the file
If your SD card isn't not showing, tap the menu on upper right of the file picker and enable "internal storage".
Let me know if that works for you!

Yes that works. Thanks!
BTW: What is the described "Import GnuCash XML" action actually for?

It allows you to pick a place to import from, and actually used to work as you expect it to.
We only recently removed the permissions for direct access to the SD card.
So maybe we need to revisit that option and adapt it to the new procedures.

Alright, thanks for the explanation!

Hi,
I've the same or a similar problem on the android version. I faces the same error when I try to import a gnucash file from my dropbox where I saved the file I've created in Ubuntu.
Circumventing is not possible since "opening" is only available for google drive (but in "importint" dropbox is there).
