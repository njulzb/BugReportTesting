title:[UNVERIFIED] App closes on launch instead of displaying wizard

codinguser
Hello Sir/Madam,
I installed GNUCash app on my android phone OnePlus 3T which is running on MarshMallow version today.
When I tried to load the app, it showed me welcome message and asked me to choose how to set up my accounts, when I clicked finish button, app disappeared. I tried reinstalling the app multiple times, but each time the same issue is repeating. Kindly help. Thanks in advance.
The app should continue through the wizard and guide user through setup.
The app closes.   In fact once the app crashes, next time it wont even load unless I goto Settings->Apps->GnuCash->Clear Data.
This issue occurred when the option to "let me handle it" for account creation was selected in the wizard.
Now fixed since v2.1.5
