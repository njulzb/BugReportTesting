title:Default transaction types are swapped

In settings, when I choose "credit" default transaction type, "debit" is chosen by default when creating new transaction. When I choose "debit", then "credit" is chosen.
I have also observed this behavior.  Furthermore, the uses of Credit and
Debit in GnuCash for Android are inconsistent (specifically, the reverse)
with the use of Credit and Debit in the GnuCash desktop application (formal
accounting labels).

As of 3dde0ab custom account labels are used. Also the default setting of transaction type is interpreted as "start with entry which causes account balance to go down". What kind (credit or debit) which is then selected depends on the type of account
