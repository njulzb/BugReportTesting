title:Settings do not open with new Material theme

Settings activity opens, but the different sections crash the app.
@rivaldi8 Could you look into it?

In a device with Android 4.4.2 (API 19) it fails with the following error:
I can't reproduce it in Android 2.3.5  (API 10) as it doesn't show the sections in separate fragments.
