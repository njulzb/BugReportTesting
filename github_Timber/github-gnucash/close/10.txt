Hi!
First of all I would like to congrat with you for the app.
Do you think to implement the double-entry?
I wish I could save if I paid in cash or by credit card, as in the desktop app.
Cheers,
Marco
Thanks Marco. Sorry, but double entry is not planned for now.

I think that TyraelTLK idea is good.
I wish some functionallity like this, it is very useful to have some way to manage money in desktop app.
I understand if this suggestion is not easy to implement now, but please keep in future work.

Yes, I was surprised, too, to see GnuCash without double-entry. I have to admit that I didn't test importing on desktop, yet, but won't it be a hassle to assign all my expenses to their respective accounts on import?
To have a useful integration with the desktop, import must be fast and easy.
