title:Play music from URL

I'm trying to play music from a URL, and the MusicPlayer class doesnt have a setDataSource method, only the MusicSerice class has a setDataSource method, but I'm not sure which is the best way to use that class.
Can you help out on how to play music from a url?
I found a method:
MusicPlayer.openFile(URL);
so I used that and the method below to play the music
MusicPlayer.playOrPause()
