title:No problems, just love

Hi there!
Just wanted to thank all the contributors for this good work. This music player is awesome, clean, usable, and reads m3u files, it's perfect!!
Just one request: lyrics. But I saw the PR, I can't wait to see it merged!
Much love for y'all <3
So this is nice to see, and the developer does deserve praise, but it should probably be done via twitter, not as a bug in the bug tracker.
