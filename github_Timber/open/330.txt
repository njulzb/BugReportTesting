title:AlarmManager.set is treated as inexact after API 19

Hi, for your information, after API 19, AlarmManager.set will not schedule the alarms at the exact time specified.(doc) I found it is used in MusicService to schedule a shutdown. If sending the alarm at the exact time is desired, setExact will be an alternative.
Is there timer shutdown in Timber? I didn't know that...

@anburocky3 seems yes? After some time not playing anything, the MusicService will be shutdown

Is there any AutoTimer feature in Timber? That will execute the shutdown after specific time?
