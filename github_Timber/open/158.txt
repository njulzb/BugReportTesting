Why not make it more easy?
Add a "Play"-Symbol and/or the "Cross-arrow" symbol also available directly on top of each album in the "Album List" view!
The same counts for the "Artist List"!
To play an entire Album or all songs of an Artist you only need ONE tap (instead of now 2-3).
And I also find no solution for "Add Album to Queu" and "Add Artist to Queu" (or to "Current Playlist" / "Now Playing").
Does it not exist or did I simply not find it?
But in my opinion it should als be available with longtap (or "...") onto an Album or Artist!
