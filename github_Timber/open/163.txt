title:[QUESTION] Are these GitHub-Issues read by the programmers?

I am new in using Timber, but I like it very much and want to help to improve it.
Therefore I opened some issue tickets one week ago.
But I wonder, why no discussion continues about it....are at least any reaction....?
Also older posts are rarely commented or moderated....
So my question:
--> Is this Issue-Tracker read by the programmer(s)? <--
If I can't see any reaction within the next 2 weeks I feels not anymore confident that I want support timber anymore...
So, lets see any reaction....
Thanks, Robert
Hey,
Thanks for your interest in Timber. Yes, the issues are definitely read but the only difference is that there's only one person (me) working on this project. I am a 2nd year Engineering student with lots of other things to work on including studies and other side projects. I can only contribute small amount of time on Timber and that's why Timber is completely free ond open source so that other developers can contribute to it.
I do read all the issues and work on them when I have free time to work upon. I will try to contribute more time on this project though in future.
Thanks,
Naman

Thanks for your kind response.
Maybe you can just make a comment to the different open issues, if they need much work or if it can be easily integrated to the next version.
...and in which timeframe you could imagine to release a next update ....
I more wanted to say that it would be nice to read some short updates of information while I don't wanted to force you to take more of your time to program Timber....
Best regards, Robert

I will make sure to provide updates on issues from now on so that it's easy for people to track the progress.
