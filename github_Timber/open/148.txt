title:Randomly pauses between tracks

Occasionally I find that Timber has paused itself between tracks while listening and I need to press Skip for it to come back (Play doesn't seem to work). I listen to music almost exclusively over Bluetooth, so I don't know if this will occur in other contexts. The problem does not seem to occur with Vanilla Music.
Looking at my log, this appears to be the relevant message starting the process of pausing the audio system.

If you need me to, I can get a fuller log of the event.
