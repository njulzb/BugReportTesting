title:[IMPROVMENT] Pre-load of album covers while scrolling through "Album List"

When I am scrolling through the album list (in raster/thumbnail-mode) the covers are only loaded/displayed at the moment when I am reaching this album.
If I scroll fast, loading/displaying the covers are slower than the scroll speed, which results in empty covers. Loading takes about ~0.5seconds, which is way to long.
--> It would be better if all covers are loaded when entering the "Album View" mode. Or at least assure enough covers are prefetched that scrolling can be performed without display-lacks.
Thanks!
