title:Crash when sliding the seek bar to the tracks end

Sometimes Timber crashes when you slide the seek bar to the end while a track is playing. I tested this with 10 different tracks and it crashes in about half of the cases.  Can you confirm this?
Here is some information about my phone and I also included my error log.
Phone: Samsung Galaxy S3 GT-I9305
Android version 4.4.4.
CyanogenMod version 11-20150406-NIGHTLY-i9305

I also noticed that this usually happens when the repeat song setting is on and you have pressed "shuffle all".
