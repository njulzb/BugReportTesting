title:Jumping images in RecyclerView

In the artists recyclerview, doing a quick scroll results in the images changing very frequently 2-3 times and then finally settling upon the correct one.
This is a known issue with recyclerview and images, With Volley this maybe fixed if we cancel the request when item has disappeared from the screen but I am still looking for a better solution to this problem.

I'll have a look once at the code and see if I can help here.
