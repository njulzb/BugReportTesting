title:Album art zoomed in when playing individual track

Go to Albums and select an album.  You see cover art displayed properly.  Then play one of the tracks.  The cover art gets zoomed in and is too big for the screen.
I always thought of this as a design choice, and I personally like it. I can see how it can ruin certain cover images though, an option would be optimal.
