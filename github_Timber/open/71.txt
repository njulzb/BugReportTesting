title:[Feature request] Accelerometer shake (example: so you can skip that one track without having to take the phone out of your pocket)

That would be a killer feature.
And it could be customized in Settings so that users could change the shake option to trigger something else, like play/pause, previous track, toggle repeat, etc.
Root is not required. Another app (which too coincidentally is open source) has this feature already.
But Timber is far more beautiful, polished, and easy to use, so I would rather Timber have this feature.
@naman14 may I work on this feature?
