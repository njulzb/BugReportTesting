title:App crashes when go to artist/album is accessed from search results

No response is received on clicking either delete or share from the three dots menu on each of the fetched music files. In other words both options are inactive.
You should arrive at the music library on launching the app
From the library, locate the songs tab
Just at the right corner, above the songs tab, you will find a search icon.
Click on the search icon and input a keyword. The results should appear simultaneously.
Click on the three dots attached to any of the results and choose either delete or share from the pop up menu.
You should find them dormant, which is similar to my experience.
Browser/App version: v1.6
