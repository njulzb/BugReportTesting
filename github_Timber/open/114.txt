title:Headphones button presses

Do not play/pause or play next track.
It's not implemented or ?
VanillaMusicPlayer/VLC work ok: 1 press pause/play, 2 presses next track.
The function seems to be implemented. I can change tracks ny long pressing the volume buttons, ALTHOUGH I did report a bug where it would clash with Vanilla and causes the phone to lockup.

Not working here.
If Vanilla is installed, even if not started, it will start and play on button press.
Uninstall Vanilla and the button does not work, not even with Timber started and in view.
Vanilla has a feature named "Emulate stock broadcasts" maybe that's the key.

Hm, actually you are right. I uninstalled Vanilla and it doesnt work anymore. Reinstalling it too does not change anything, it launches vanilla and plays music in that player while pausing Timber. I have had issues in the past where sometimes they play simultaneously and my phone ended up locking down on me. So I cannot recommend trying to use both at the moment.

It wasn't working in previous versions for me but with the latest, it does.
