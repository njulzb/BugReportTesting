title:feature request: seekbar in notification

No description provided.
Is this possible? I haven't seen it yet in any app. Progress bar maybe be possible but I dont think seekbar can be possible(if trying to slide the seekbar, I think notification will slide instead).

Will it be possible in the lockscreen widget then ?
