title:Cannot install on Android 5.0.2

Hello,
i tried to download apk from releases section but i can't install on my device (Android 5.0.2).
I had the same issue with other apps and it resulted to be a bug with android build tools:

Thanks
Who has Android 5.0.2 installed this time? Android 9 is on the way so I would suggest to update either your Android Version or your smartphone... ;)
