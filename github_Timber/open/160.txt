title:[Feature Request] Add the possibility to crawl "Folders" at the storage

I would highly welcome the possibility to crawl also directly my folder structure at the storage.
This could be useful...
1.) ...when some artists have wrong artist's spellings inside an MP3-tag, but are all contained at one folder.
2.) ...if I have e.g. two folders, one with "Music" and one with "Audiobooks". Now I want only to use the "Music" folder to perform "Play All", but not having the "Audiobooks" in the music playlist.
I second this request, it would be a very usefull improvement!
If possible, include the folder view in the main sections (likeTracks, Albums, Artists) with a default folder you can define/modify in app setup.
Another releavant detail is to not include only audio files from the selected folder but also include all audio files found in the subfolders.
For example, if u/therob84's "Music" folder contains subfolders such as "Artist1", "Artist2", ... "ArtistN" ; selecting "Play All" for "Music" folder should include all audio files from "Artist1", "Artist2", ... "ArtistN" folders in the queue list.

Is this requesting the same feature as #8? Or is this different?
