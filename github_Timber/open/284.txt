title:when shuffle play, playing queue doesn't rearrange in new and actual order

If I start a playlist with shuffle, Timber should rearrange the playing queue...so I could temporarely rearrange some songs in the playing queue after starting a shuffled play...
Thanks for the great music player! This is the only thing I'm missing...
