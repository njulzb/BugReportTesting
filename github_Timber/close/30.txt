Must music players pause on disconnecting headphones, some make it a setting. Stopping is most likely not what you want, because you lose where you were in the song. I'm most likely nitpicking word choice here, though.

@TheLastProject Yeah, you are nitpicking, but it's a sensible nitpick. I meant 'pause'.
