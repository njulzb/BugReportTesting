title:F-Droid version outdated

HI there,
I just wanted to point out that the F-Droid version of Timber is outdated.
Build log:
https://f-droid.org/wiki/page/naman14.timber
It appears that @naman14 may have accidentally re-added the the Fabric API entry to AndroidManifest.xml on the f-droid branch in 926127c
I'm guessing this is what's preventing F-Droid from building v16
Tagging @krt16s as the original filer of #219

@gsantner more like https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.foobar2000.foobar2000
Opus support ftw.

At this point the latest release is one year old anyway. Rushing to get that on F-droid rather than pushing a new version doesn't seem like a priority.

I've stopped using / did use   Timber a long time ago and I'm happy with Vanilla. Closing.

@gsantner This bug is not solved even if our interest in the app may decrease. Please re-open this bug, some people may be still interested. :)

@naman14 Could you please make a flavor for the newest version as the current one on F-Droid is still 0.2b?

Dont ask, owner seems not to be further interested in getting users via F-Droid.
