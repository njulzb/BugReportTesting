title:Wrong song order in albums

I don't know why the order of the songs in the album are wrong, as you can see in the screenshots below, the order is totally random:

Is this a known issue? Thanks for the app, it's wonderful nonetheless ðŸ˜„
Yeah, its a known issue, will fix it in next release, forgot to add the sorting order for album songsðŸ˜‘

Hey, just checked the code and I am sorting the albums with default sort order. As you can see in the screenshot, the songs are sorted alphabetically. Maybe I will add options for more sort orders probably in some next releases

I think that the default order should be by song number and not alphabetically, but an option to choose between them would be great!
