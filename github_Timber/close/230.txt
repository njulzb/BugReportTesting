title:If I use this source code and redistribute the app should I release the corresponding source code also?

Since this is GPL licensed should I release the source code of the application I built by modifying this source code?

if you release the modified version to the public in some way, the GPL requires you to make the modified source code available to the program's users, under the GPL.
So yeah if you release an app based on this code you must release the source code and also license it in GPL.
