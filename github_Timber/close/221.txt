You can use MusicPlayer.openFile(String filePath)
You can also checkout the actual implementation in MusicService.openFile(String path)

MusicPlayer.playOrPause(); should result in onMetaChanged being called.
You can create a pull request of existing implementation. I will implement the meta fetching if you are having trouble.
