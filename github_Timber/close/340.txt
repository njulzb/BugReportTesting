title:Notification tool doesn't change aspect of playlist

When i open music in playlists, notification is open. And when i click next, previous or stop; it is doing action in background but nothing happen visually in playlist activity. For example;
At start, I chose 1 music.
As you see, in notification tool we started to see now playing music.
Then, I clicked next button to open next music, and Timber started to play next music.
But in playlistactivity nothing happened.
