title:Pause and playback dont work on the earphones

When I pause the song from my earphones it takes long to pause but eventually does but on trying to playback the song via the earphones it doesn't work.
This issue is already reported in #15. Would you mind adding your comment there? It would also be helpful to know your Timber and Android versions as well as your device model. Thanks!
