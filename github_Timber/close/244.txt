title:Null Pointer Exception for Folder view

ListFiles() in FolderLoader class returning null for lower versions of android like 4.4 and 5
resulting in null pointer exception and forcing the app to close
i solved it by replacing to
public String getDirectoryFolder()
{
return mPreferences.getString(LAST_DIRECTORY_FOLDER, Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory().getPath());
}
in Preference Utility
