title:On fourth now playing style, 10+ minute times are not shown correctly

How to reproduce:
Expected result: 10:00 is displayed in playing time
Actual result: 0:00 is displayed in playing time
Workaround: Background app and foreground it again, which causes the time to be displayed correctly
Hmm, never tested on 10+ minute song. Looking into it

With a 1 hour and 28 minute song, I managed to confirms something even more messed up happens at the 60 minute mark: The timer goes from 59:59 to 19:09, somehow, and stays stuck on it, only updating to 19:19/19:29/19:39, etc.?!
The song I used to test is available from https://telepathtelepath.bandcamp.com/album/--30.

It gets even better at the end of the song:

@TheLastProject the wrapper around TimelyTextView I used is not tested for songs greater than 10 minutes.The problem is TimelyTextView only supports transitioning between single digits.(It's not a simple setText to any other number) It can animate between 4 and 5 but it can't animate between 45 to 46. So for overcoming this, I created a wrapper around it which individually animates each digits to the next respective digits. Things starts to get complicated when even a single digit is added to the numbers. So for animating 6:40 to 6:41, there's three separate but continuous transitions. As you can understand now, if we reach 4 digits and then 5 digits, things gets even more complicated. Since I didn't had any 10+minute song, so i didn't tested it properly.
Anyways,working on it, this should be fixed soon.

Assuming this got into release 0.122b (I don't see that number in the commit history), it wasn't properly fixed. Put on a song, skip to 9:50 or so and wait for it to switch from 9:59 to... 0:00.
