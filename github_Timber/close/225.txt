title:App crashes on startup on CopperheadOS based on AOSP (Android 7.0.0)

Hi!
Since version 0.21b (FDroid version), Timber crashes when I try to start the app. I'm using a Nexus 6p with CopperheadOS. I tried deleting app data, but that did not help.
Here is a crash log:
Have been fixed in 0cb2c09
Will update the version on f-droid
