title:Problems regarding foreign languages.

Some letters in foreign languages, such as æ, ø, and å, does not display correctly. This is a big concern for non-english speaking countries. Having the bug fix, or at least adding the option to "Force English" would be nice.
Where are you seeing letters displayed incorrectly? In the UI or in music tags? If the problem is with music tags, I would check that the tags are properly encoded with UTF-8. My music with non-ASCII character is displayed just fine.

So far... only UI, Haven't checked for other occurrences.

Ok, this is Danish, isn't it? The translation file (app/src/main/res/values-da/strings.xml) isn't properly encoded in UTF-8. Could you fix the problematic strings and send a pull request or attach the file?

I would. But the file looks complete. It is already formatted in UTF-8, and the strings looks fine.

Where are you opening the file? From Android Studio it's the only language that looks wrong.

I looked at the XML on GitHub... On GitHub the formatting and syntax of the strings and XML looks fine.
I might be a programmer... but I don't have Android Studio installed.
