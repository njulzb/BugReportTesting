To make testing of the fix easier I've prepared an APK here. It will be installed as an independent application with the name "Timber devel", so it won't interfere with the official Timber you already have installed. It still doesn't solve the problem for all cases, though:
I still haven't find out why these don't work.
This APK also contains the changes in these pull requests. If you feel like testing them too, any feedback would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!
