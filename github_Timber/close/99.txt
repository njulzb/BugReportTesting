Regarding the equalizer issue you mentioned. If I'm not mistaken the app uses the system equalizer and on some different vendor implementations ( such as HTC roms ) you don't have a system eq. available .
On samsung for example ,I can access the equalizer without any problems , but on an HTC one I can't

Equalizer should be accesible in release 0.13b on Google Play (If your device has an audio effects intent)
