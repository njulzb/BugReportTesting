title:Integrate with Continuous Integration tool - Travis CI

I'm using Travis CI in my weather application project and I must say it's really helpful. In my case, it checks if any code changes (it runs after any commit is pushed) are passing all tests or they're failing a test and than, some additional code changes are needed.
