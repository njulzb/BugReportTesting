In a view where music is playing, when I pause the music and choose "shuffle on" than music starts but the button still shows play icon instead pause icon.
Steps :> Turn on the music -> click bottom part where it displays the song detail -> Music screen appears  -> Click overflow icon -> choose shuffle all
Device :> Lg Nexus 4
OS Version :> 5.0 Lollipop
