Oops! Sorry for confusing you, What i'm trying to say is.
Whenever i press search icon, the search menu is displaying. But if you see, there is more spacing from left arrow and search textview. Got it?

Could you provide an additional screenshot to show what the app looks like both before and after pressing the search icon.
