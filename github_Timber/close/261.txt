title:A few issues

How do I set this app what do I need to do I installed the plugin and signed up on their site?
This also shows up in my gradle console:
Also when I select folders the app crashes.
Not sure if anyone else noticed this but the app does a lot of crashing even on certain now playing screen types. The 2nd now playing crashes & playlists crashes I figured I'd let you know about those issues as well.
I'm really needing help with this please?
