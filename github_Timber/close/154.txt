title:[Feature request] Home screen widget

Is it possible to add a home screen widget? I liked the one from the HTC player with album art, prev, play / pause, and next (4x1). It's a nice alternative to the notification bar.

I'm going to replace mighty proprietary PowerAmp with this player, currently my widget looks like this:

I've seen it already, it looks nice in 4x1 size, but doesn't scale well for 4x2 (don't think more makes sense).
Could you center on bigger sizes like on screenshot above?

Complete transparency would be a nice option too if not too difficult to implement.
