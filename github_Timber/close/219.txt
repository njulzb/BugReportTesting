title:Provide pure floss build flavor

Crashlytics has recently been added (#217). This is non-free software and we at f-droid cannot build further versions. Could you provide a pure gradle vuld flavor that does not use non-free software?
Hi, I have pushed a new branch (f-droid) that doesn't have crashlytics.
Let me know if its fine or if something else is required.

If that's easier to maintain for you, I am fine with that. https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/commit/3be232f9bd7331309743934b304a496773ddd55f should build tonight. Thanks for the quick fix.

@krt16s There were some crashes on the previous version which I have fixed now. Can you please initiate the latest build process for f-droid.

I don't see any new commits in the f-droid branch, 0.2b (14) is build from 3406f4e which is still the latest commit there.

Sorry, just checked the commit history on Gitlab and the update to 14(0.2b) is there, but the repository page on f-droid has v13 currently (https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=Timber&fdid=naman14.timber)

It's already build, see https://f-droid.org/wiki/page/naman14.timber, just waiting for publishing. Should be fixed in a couple of hours.
