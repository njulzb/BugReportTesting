Excuse me, this library file can not download, resulting in compile project error, the library file used by the project has jar file? @ueman @airon90 @rivaldi8
It's is working for me, even after cleaning the project and Gradle cache. Maybe I still have it downloaded in some other cache I've missed. I'm not familiar with how exactly Gradle manages dependencies, but I'd say it has something to do with https://jitpack.io.
