title:[Bug] Now playing playlist empty when accessing app from notification

When you select the first two "Now Playing" themes, you get to see the songs in the album you are playing. Now when I click the notification to access the app, the playlist shows up as blank. However, when you launch the app normally, it shows up just fine.
