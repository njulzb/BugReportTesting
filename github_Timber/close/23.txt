title:Slide album art to skip track

This an idea for an enhancement.
Allow changing tracks by sliding album art to the left or right.
Saves some time and is more comfortable than hitting a small skip button.
Probably only works great in some playback screen styles
Working on it but this will take some time (requires significant code
changes).
