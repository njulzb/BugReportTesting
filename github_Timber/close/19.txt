title:Publishing on F-Droid

What should be done in order to publish this on F-Droid?
Are there any proprietary dependencies? Is it possible to build without Google Play Services, in case it is used?
The only thing that "might" be problematic are the jcenter repositories but I can't find what needs it... And it builds fine without it, they probably aren't used anymore
I can create the request for F-Droid if @naman14 wills it

@Allsimon jcenter is used to build most of the libraries in gradle.
You can surely try creating the request for F-Droid inclusion.

Doh! I mistook jcenter for sonatype. My merge request has been accepted, the app should be there in a few hours/days

I think this can be closed and marked as fixed now?
